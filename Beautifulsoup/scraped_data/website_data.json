In short, these companies are experts in tailoring brand-first driven strategies that help retailers and manufacturers navigate several critical factors within marketplace ecosystems, including: brand management; listing optimization; price monitoring; advertising; data-mining research; logistics, and customer review management.\nThese marketplaces are not one size fits all. To have a winning e-commerce business, you need access to actionable, real-time data. Without it, businesses fly blind, guessing what might work, while wasting valuable time and resources on strategies that do not deliver results. Having rich, actionable data allows businesses to fine-tune their operations for maximum efficiency and profitability.\nFor Advantage to scale and build upon existing systems with their newly acquired acquisitions, they needed a technology partner with the experience to deliver a data strategy and build a unified data warehouse and create a data-driven culture with up-to-the-minute analytics, giving leaders a clear view of operations while improving efficiencies and effectiveness across a myriad of disparate sources.\nWhat We Did\nDeveloped a powerful SaaS-built data warehouse on Azure with Snowflake\nImplementation on Azure Services, including: API Management, Blob Storage and .NET\nConstructed an ETL to deliver fully managed, serverless hybrid data integration with Azure Data Factory\nImplemented an array of AWS services, including: CloudWatch, IAM, SQS, Seller Central APIs and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)\nData visualization via Microsoft Power BI and Microsoft Power Automate to streamline repetitive tasks and paperless processes\nThe business challenge: From flying blind to actionable insights in real-time.\nData is the lifeblood of e-commerce. It not only helps businesses understand who their customers are, what they want, and how to market to them, it is also critical in determining how sellers approach their overall strategy within the marketplace itself.\nManufacturers and retailers must navigate a myriad of omni-channel layers that all require tremendous insights to stay ahead of the curve and remain competitive. And because e-commerce data exists almost entirely in a virtual space, it generates complex and comprehensive datasets that must be aligned to business processes to provide anything meaningful.\nThe challenges Advantage faced was twofold: management needed access to data in a timely manner along with an analytics solution that would allow leaders in key departments to make decisions faster and with more accuracy.\nWithout this, Advantage’s Digital Commerce unit was essentially flying blind. Lacking any IT infrastructure, leadership was forced to rely on several different island systems all pulling from disparate sources leading to fragmented, conflicting, and poor data quality.\nAnd, without any automation in place, manual intervention was required. Departments were tasked with combining, unifying, and massaging this information into excel spreadsheets and using basic third-party software tools to generate reports. Without a unified system, management was left to make decisions based on data that was weeks, and in some instances, months old.\nThis severely hindered any attempts to parse, measure and analyze any key performance indicators (KPIs) within a product’s category, while reducing the visibility on how well a product was selling, the inability to align purchasing orders from vendors with sales systems, and uncertainty with warehouse management systems for shipping and delivery.\nFrom The Client\nOur operational challenges have been extremely difficult to manage and [they] have demonstrated a high level of technical expertise, integrity, professionalism and teamwork.\n– Kendrick Oates, Product Manager at Advantage Solutions\n‍\nWinning In The E-Commerce Space.\nIn 2021, e-commerce sales amounted to approximately $4.9 trillion worldwide, according to Statista – a leading provider of market and consumer data. That figure is forecast to grow by 50 percent over the next four years, reaching nearly $7.4 trillion by 2025.\nThe complex e-commerce ecosystem is fraught with monthly, weekly, daily, and even hourly changes that include factors like pricing strategies, customer segmentation, search optimization and rankings, and product reviews.\nWinning on marketplaces like Amazon and its 5-million-plus sellers requires tremendous dedication lead by actionable insights. And in order to understand the ins and outs, companies must be laser focused on every aspect of the buyers journey to deliver a seamless experience, while improving operational effectiveness and efficiency along the way.\nAfter analyzing the business processes during a month-long discovery phase, InfoMagnus analysts and technology consultants concluded that Advantage needed a holistic, comprehensive, end-to-end solution – one that would allow team leaders to get access to near real-time data allowing key stakeholders to respond quickly to market factors and adjust the course of action if needed – ultimately transforming Advantage into a data driven business.\nTo meet the requirements, InfoMagnus designed and implemented a data warehouse that integrated several outside sources from the most important operational systems by bringing everything into a centralized location daily. The data is modeled in a way that is aligned with Advantage’s reporting and analytics needs via several dashboards and analytics solutions for different domains of the business, including: sales and brand management, inventory management, sales summary dashboards, and advertising trend analysis.\n‍\nAccelerated Growth With Data And Analytics.\nAs a trusted technology partner, InfoMagnus was able to deliver a centralized data warehouse and analytics solution on-time and on budget using several advanced technologies that will allow Advantage’s digital commerce units to absorb large amounts of information, while providing high level visibility within several category metrics.\nFrom a solution standpoint, InfoMagnus developed a completely new SaaS-based data warehouse using Snowflake hosted on Azure cloud to facilitate secure data storage, enable real-time analytics and enterprise-wide data sharing. This combination of cloud-based computing allows Advantage team members to view diverse data sets in a single, native system.\nIn an effort to accelerate growth InfoMagnus technologist architected unified API management capabilities to streamline workflows across hybrid and multicloud environments, while giving Advantage teams the ability to automate repetitive tasks and boost efficiency all within a customized dashboard.\nThinking ahead, the data platform is designed to be expandable allowing for scale, utilizing timely data driven insights with the ability – in the future – to build intelligence and AI capabilities to not only look at the historical, but to predict what is going to happen in the future with recommended actions.\n‍\nBecoming A Data Driven Business.\nWithout the right tools in place, it's difficult for businesses to make data-driven decisions.\nAdvantage's transformation into a data-driven business has allowed the company to overcome the challenges it faced with management's access to timely data and accurate analytics. The implementation of a data warehouse by InfoMagnus has given Advantage the ability to respond quickly to market factors and make adjustments as needed creating a more efficient and effective operation overall.\nshare the future\nwant to learn more about how InfoMagnus is changing the technology landscape? reach out!\nLet's Talk\nBy clicking\n“Accept All Cookies”\n, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.

Since its inception in 2008, the company has been on the front lines building technology that offers visibility to a variety of cannabis businesses through its SaaS-based product suit to deliver safe, legal and convenient access to consumers worldwide.\nLike all e-commerce businesses, Weedmaps relies heavily on aligning its data science efforts with data analysts to build upon and develop a clear picture for several different domains that support its mission to power a transparent and inclusive global cannabis economy.\nTo help ramp up its capabilities and drive profitable and sustainable revenue through client engagement, Weedmaps named InfoMagnus to their Advanced Analytical team and Business Intelligence group to support in the development of custom data sets, data modeling, domain driven data analysis and custom dashboards powered by Tableau. Team members also assist in quality assurance to deliver on data quality efforts and feature release.\nWhat We Did\nWorking with the advanced analytical team at Weedmaps, InfoMagnus assists the Business Intelligence Group in developing data assets, Tableau dashboards and critical insights to business leaders.\nInfoMagnus assists the Quality Assurance (QA) team by delivering data quality efforts, including clickstream management and feature release support.\nBuilding the future through AI Data Models, InfoMagnus delivered a number of machine-learning algorithms that support: Product Classification; Recency, Frequency and Monetary (RFM) value of customers, and Customer Lifetime Value calculations.\nEngineering Growth While Delivering Business Critical Insights.\nThe popularity of Weedmaps has grown significantly since its humble beginnings. From 24 users in the first couple of months to an average of 1,500 visitors at the end of 2008, Weedmaps has\nskyrocketed\nto more than 12.1 million visitors per month with the average user spending more than 4 minutes on the site and averaging 4.13 pages per visit.\n\"The insights from\nWeedmaps’ Cannabis in America report\nvalidate what we see every day: The stigma around cannabis is fading as it becomes more embedded in our culture and daily lives,” said Chris Beals, CEO of WM Technology. “This report highlights attitudes and trends within the industry by providing data and information directly from consumers — an important step as we work towards the goal of building a transparent and inclusive cannabis economy.”\nTo harness and utilize the tsunami of data funneling in from the website and its Android and iOS applications, Weedmaps enlisted InfoMagnus data analysis's to deliver an API integration via Twilio Segment to better understand how users are interacting on the platform.\nWith insights that aim to unify customer touch points across platforms and channels, Weedmaps can act on website and app events that dive deep into individual user personas, while segmenting audiences to deliver messaging capabilities that reach the right customers at the right time.\nTo help increase the performance speed of data analysis queries, everything from website engagement data, to paid advertising, social interaction and email are collected from Segment and brought into Amazon Redshift where several different schemas are used to deliver extremely detailed user insights and behaviors. From there, InfoMagnus builds customized dashboards for product and marketing teams as well as leadership and investors to determine the current and future performance of its products and services.\n‍\nBuilding The Future With AI-Driven Data Models.\nAs an online marketplace with thousands of products from hundreds of vendors, WeedMaps required a solution that would help them make sense of large and complex data sets, identify patterns and trends, help automate processes, while improving customer service and creating a more personalized experience.\nIn order to transform and modernize their current capabilities, InfoMagnus engineered three specific AI-driven, machine learning models that include: product classification; recency, frequency and monetary (RFM) values, and calculations for customer lifetime value.\n‍\nProduct Classification\n: With thousands of products covering a myriad of categories, Weedmaps needed a solution that would allow them to help support their curation team and reduce the tedious and manual efforts associated with product nuance. InfoMagnus developed a product classification algorithm, which uses an advanced deep-learning model to encode thousands of product names within their catalog. The new algorithm allows the curation team to process and deliver an extremely accurate cadence within product-like differentiation and can also be used to create custom recommendation engines.\nRFM Modeling\n: The ability to understand and score high and low value customers is an important way for companies like Weedmaps to gather a holistic view of their audience.\nThe recency, frequency, and monetary value (RFM) model InfoMagnus developed can be used to segment customers based on their purchase behavior. This model looks at three factors: recency (how recently a customer has made a purchase), frequency (how often a customer makes a purchase), and monetary value (how much money a customer spends per purchase). By segmenting customers based on these factors, Weedmaps can better target their marketing and sales efforts. Additionally, the RFM model can also be used to predict customer churn and identify what customers are most likely to defect to a competitor.\nCustomer Lifetime Value\n: InfoMagnus also developed a customer lifetime value calculation that allows Weedmaps to determine the estimated revenue they can generate from a customer over the course of their relationship. The forecast delivers a 30, 60, and 90-day probability of an individual's loyalty to the Weedmaps brand. This calculation uses the lifetime library of Python developed by MIT and takes into account factors such as customer acquisition costs, retention rates, and average purchase values. Additionally, this calculation can also be used to help companies make decisions about marketing and pricing strategies with a 95% or higher accuracy rate.\nFrom The Client\nThe stigma around cannabis is fading as it becomes more embedded in our culture and daily lives.\n– Chris Beals, CEO of WM Technology\n‍\nDelivering High-Level Insights To Business Teams And Investors.\nWith revenues exceeding $193M in 2021, Weedmaps remains the largest e-commerce platform in the cannabis industry. But with competition around every corner, the company remains steadfast in its pursuit to continue building upon its technology and leveraging data to drive outcomes.\n“… Weedmaps [is] beginning to make its unparalleled levels of cannabis industry data available to policy makers, cannabis business holders and industry investors to help them make more informed and accurate decisions,” said Beals.\nWhether it is problem solving or visibility into several of the company’s domains, including products, storefronts, and delivery, leaders and advisors need access to metrics that provide daily, monthly and yearly KPIs and other operational data specific to each area of the business.\nKnown as “strategic pillars,” at Weedmaps, these areas of focus deliver insights to executives in the C-suite and investment arms, which allow them to make educated decisions and determinations for the clients it serves, the consumers it provides for and the many divisions within the company itself.\nTo allow teams, leadership, and advisors a complete 360-degree view of its business operations, InfoMagnus technologists work closely with management to analyze and assess several areas that are critical in delivering internal and global solutions. With visual insights powered by Tableau, InfoMagnus developed several customizable dashboards that give leadership the ability to consume and understand information easily, with the ability to break data down into different dimensions and attributes.\nArmed with these insights, leadership can make better decisions and help develop better relationships with its retailers, expand offerings, increase revenue and increase its footprint throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, and beyond.\nshare the future\nwant to learn more about how InfoMagnus is changing the technology landscape? reach out!\nLet's Talk\nBy clicking\n“Accept All Cookies”\n, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.

The Captis I-4 system, which stands for:\nIntelligence, Information, Investigation, Identification\n, not only answers the complex demands on security professionals, it creates the ability to operate on the offensive; a comprehensive cloud-based platform that provides intelligence on a pre- and post-crime incident basis to identify and deter criminal activity resulting in significant crime reduction and prevention.\nThe advancement of the I-4 solution utilizes a number of AWS services, tools and functionalities that provide more than security: the technology delivers optimized asset protection processes; significantly reduces costs; elevates strain on local law enforcement agencies, and proactively manages risk for clients and local communities.\nWhat We Did\nImplementation of a content deliver network (CDN) via Amazon Cloudfront\nDistribution of incoming application traffic across multiple targets using Elastic Load Balancer\nProvided secure, resizable compute capacity to the cloud via Amazon EC2\nDelivered object storage services via Amazon S3\nImplemented Amazon Rekognition and AWS Fargate for detection and machine learning video analysis\nThe business challenge:\nBuild a highly engaged community of individuals to assist in deterring and solving crime.\nToday's law enforcement agencies face a number of obstacles in their efforts to help deter criminal activity and solve crimes throughout the nation: underfunded and understaffed agencies simply cannot provide the resources needed to maintain the high volumes of incidents within a geographic area.\nDespite significant technological advances, more than 60% of the crimes committed in the United States go unsolved. That national statistic has not improved in over a decade. The rapid expansion of surveillance systems has played a key role in providing evidence of specific crime incidents to law enforcement, but the chances of identifying the suspect remain low: scaled-back law enforcement agencies across the country are expected to conduct costly and labor-intensive investigations on a rapidly increasing flow of crime incidents captured on private surveillance systems.\nCaptis Intelligence’s Solveacrime.com (SAC) platform supports a database of more than 500GB, housing some 73 million persons of interest (POI); 53 million crime feed records and 2,600 active crimes waiting to be solved.\n‍\nNavigating Change with the Captis SAC Platform: Preparing for Future Growth.\nBuilt for large amounts of immediate “minute-interactions”, Solveacrime.com’s patented technology utilizes advanced analytics and algorithms and over a dozen forms of digital communication to harness the power of meaningful community engagement. The vast Captis Community is comprised of 10’s of millions of participants, multiple social media conduits, community watch organizations, micro-influencers, virtual communities, and localized digital media. Through its amplification by social reaction, the network of viewers multiplies.\nCaptis Intelligence partnered with InfoMagnus to develop the SAC platform from the ground up. The initial scope of the project included the implementation of nine public resources using create, read, update, delete (CRUD) endpoints, which included users on the platform, organizations, incidents within a geographic area and POIs.\nThroughout development of the Captis SAC platform, the InfoMagnus team was able to pivot and respond swiftly to changes within the initial scope of the project: Whether it was adding additional entities; writing advanced business logic to support database requirements; capturing all research and development activities, and internal support operations for the webbapp, admin, app, api servers and batch servers. In order to plan and scale for the future and meet demands, InfoMagnus relied on Amazon Rekognition and AWS Fargate for detection and machine learning video analysis.\nFrom The Client\n\"The team at InfoMagnus delivered the right technologies and support for our industry-first, Solveacrime.com product, allowing us to achieve the desired timeframe and take the product to market.\"\n– Dario Brebric, President of Captis Intelligence\n‍\nExceeding Expectations with InfoMagnus: Delivering Projects on Time and Within Budget.\nAs a trusted technology partner, InfoMagnus was able to exceed expectations by delivering an execution branch and following the clients requirements to exacting specifications. Any time there was a deviation, such as time constraints, it was managed and delivered on time and within budget.\nOne example included the high-visibility Milestone integration, which included the implementation of a sophisticated customer user experience to drive a more rapid and user-friendly on-boarding experience.\nInfoMagnus technologists were also able to meet expectations for Captis Intelligence and reduce costs by cleaning irrelevant data in the database of corrupt and inaccurate records, while resolving performance issues using a number of strategic hands-on workarounds, including a ramp-up of the technology stack via Spring-Everything.\n‍\nAdapting to Change and Scaling Up: Growing a Research and Design Team for Future Needs.\nCaptis Intelligence's solveacrime.com platform has expanded from an initial engagement of three months to more than five years. The team delivered value by addressing changes quickly and professionally, while growing our research and design organization to 10 developers to support incoming requests.\nIn more than 70% of cases, SAC has resulted in a significant reduction in future criminal incidents occurring at a given location. Captis solveacrime.com has been successful in identifying, locating and assisting in the apprehension of criminals as well as in the generation of publicity about crimes being committed and solved, resulting in a significant reduction in theft incidents at businesses using the site. Today, the Captis SAC platform has more than 2,344 active crime listings, by which the public has contributed and solved some 143 crimes.\nshare the future\nwant to learn more about how InfoMagnus is changing the technology landscape? reach out!\nLet's Talk\nBy clicking\n“Accept All Cookies”\n, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.

This is achieved by providing a variety of views, allowing an operations team to identify bottlenecks and to uncover areas for improvement.\nGeoStamp offers the user analytical insights that allows for historical views or real-time perspective. GeoStamp easily integrates into GPS providers, dispatch systems and financial systems.\nThe custom software developed by InfoMagnus currently measures turn times for more than 9,000 trucks in over 500 facilities and is used by trucking companies, container shipping companies, by marine terminal operators and rail yard operators. Seven trucking associations and eight government entities trust GeoStamp to deliver accurate and real-time data.\nWhat We Did\nImplementation of Microsoft .NET Framework\nImplementation of Microsoft Azure\nAzure SQL Database\nMicrosoft Power BI\nThe business challenge:\nTo improve the efficacy of shipping port terminal operations.\nBefore InfoMagnus stepped in to build technology that would assist in measuring turn time–the amount of time it takes a cargo truck to enter the port terminal, load or unload its cargo, and exit the port terminal–the process was a complex and often a manual effort.\nThe industry needed an automated and more reliable way to capture turn time. A lack of reliable, real-time measurement led to traffic congestion in the port and long wait times for trucking companies. This translated into lost opportunity and lost revenue. It also meant that the port terminals had a lack of consistent data by which to measure their own performance.\n‍\nMaking Moves: How GeoStamp Automates Turn Time and Increases Business Efficiency.\nWith technology powered by InfoMagnus, Transportation Software Solutions (TSS) developed a product called GeoStamp. GeoStamp software automates the collection of turn time and provides accurate data by which to make real-time decisions and measure performance. The product works seamlessly with GPS providers to collect data and deliver clear, accessible analytics. This allows GeoStamp clients to develop greater efficiency in their business and increase the total number of moves transacted.\nThe software provides a variety of data views, allowing an operations team to identify traffic bottlenecks and uncover areas for improvement.\nGeoStamp also offers trucking management system and invoice integration that provides a seamless and transparent syntheses with financial systems. The software operates exclusively in the cloud and requires little to no management.\nIndividual companies purchase data subscription for approximately $1,500 per month. Larger organizations, such as port authorities, purchase aggregate data for $6,000 per month.\nFrom The Client\n\"We significantly increased our revenue per truck as a result of GeoStamp developing a SaaS based trucks monitoring system that integrated GPS, dispatch and accounting systems.\"\n– Brian Griley, President and CEO, Southern Counties Express\n‍\nTurning Up the Efficiency: Using Clear Data to Improve Port Terminal Performance.\nThe access to clear, real-time, actionable data is improving performance measurement and port terminal efficacy. Marine terminal operators have become more efficient and can compare their performance with other port terminals. They now have a better mechanism to help them pinpoint areas of improvement.\nGeoStamp currently measures turn time for approximately 9,000 trucks and over 500 facilities including marine terminals, rail yards, distribution centers, warehouses, customer yards, storage yards and transportation corridors.\nIt is used by trucking companies, container shipping companies, marine terminal operators, and rail yards.\n‍\nReassurance on the Road: How Automation & Seamless Billing Improve Customer Service for Trucking Companies.\nTrucking companies have been able to increase revenue. Based on predictions and aggregate reports, they can choose the fastest terminals, therefore increasing the amount of total transactions. They also have a mechanism to accurately bill their client for wait time at the port terminals. Trucking companies can use performance data to negotiate contract pricing.\nThe data enables them to show customers how their performance compares to other trucking companies.\nAutomation has improved real-time data accuracy. With dispatch integration, container number, leg type, and other relevant customer information is available that allows for seamless billing and reduced manual processes. The customers of GeoStamp trucking companies no longer have to rely on physical tickets or verbal validation. GeoStamp reports are irrefutable.\nshare the future\nwant to learn more about how InfoMagnus is changing the technology landscape? reach out!\nLet's Talk\nBy clicking\n“Accept All Cookies”\n, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.

This created a complex technical environment and complicated the access and extraction of data both internally and to service teams in the field.\nData integrity suffered from limitations imposed by structure, history, and multiple technologies, while accurate reporting and data analysis became increasingly difficult.\nThe data Advantage collects contains critical information that produces instructions so that Advantage service teams can perform their duties and provide consumer insights.\nFrom The Client\nInfomagnus has been an exceptional partner in several large initiatives at Advantage. They have demonstrated the ability to architect, build and maintain several enterprise level, custom built applications.\n– Bill Crane, Director of Application Development\n‍\nIn Pursuit of Big Data Success: Exploring the Multi-Year Data Warehouse Modernization and Advanced Analytics Project.\nAdvantage partnered with InfoMagnus to embark on a multi-year data warehouse modernization and advanced analytics project.\nThe first phase was to build a data warehouse strategy to combine the Retail Services data warehouse and Advantage Retail Technology Services (ARTS) data warehouse into a single solution which serves as the reporting data source for internal teams and Advantage field representatives.\nIn stride, InfoMagnus technologist began the design and implementation of the data warehouse strategy, which included:\n‍\nSelection of the appropriate technology,\nArchitecture of new data warehouse and its implementation,\nApplication of common data structures & technology,\nConfiguration & sizing of the development, test and production environments,\nDesign, documentation, testing, & implementation of the necessary ETL process,\nDesign, documentation, and implementation of reports and dashboards.\n‍\nThe Success of the Unified Data Warehouse.\nThe unified data warehouse has been successfully designed and implemented within the agreed time and budget. Technical complexity has been reduced and organizational efficiencies have been achieved.\nThe system design and technology stack were reviewed by experts from Amazon, Talend and third-party consultants and was recognized as having a “Robust Design” aligned with industry best practices.\nshare the future\nwant to learn more about how InfoMagnus is changing the technology landscape? reach out!\nLet's Talk\nBy clicking\n“Accept All Cookies”\n, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.

Their journey has been marked by an ambitious growth strategy, with over 50 acquisitions since 2014 propelling them to the forefront as the nation's premier provider of in-store sales, merchandising, and marketing services.\nTheir clientele is a veritable who's who of the retail and consumer-packaged goods (CPGs) industries. From retail giants like Costco, Walmart, Target, and Kroger to renowned CPG brands such as Unilever, Mars Wrigley, Bayer, and SC Johnson, Advantage Solutions has been the go-to partner for those seeking to enhance their brand value.\n‍\nWhat We Did\nDesigned, built, deployed, and configured a unified data warehouse using Snowflake.\nUtilized Amazon Web Services (AWS) for hosting the new data warehouse.\nEmployed the third-party tool, Talend, for data extraction from various source systems.\nLeveraged Amazon S3 storage for data security and unlimited storage.\nImplemented AWS Direct Connect for rapid data replication from the on-premises database to the AWS-hosted Snowflake.\nNavigating the Maze: Advantage Solutions' Journey Towards Technological Consolidation.\nAdvantage Solutions found itself in a complex labyrinth of overlapping customer bases as a result of its numerous acquisitions. Each business unit, having its own unique technology solution, operated independent data warehouses and analytics tools. The company's approach to providing a unified view of data involved a daily ingestion of information from each data warehouse, followed by a manual transformation into a standardized data set. This data set was then disseminated through enterprise reports via the customer's preferred tool. However, this daily process was not immune to human error and fell short of meeting the customer's growing demand for near real-time insights.\nAs the company expanded its services to a larger number of Consumer-Packaged Goods (CPGs) across multiple business units, the volume of issues began to surge. Over a span of two years, the percentage of CPGs serviced simultaneously by multiple Advantage Solutions business units ballooned from 28% to over 80%. This growth was accompanied by an inconsistency in delivering the promised enterprise reports to the CPGs.\nIn an effort to mitigate the risk of service reduction and potential breach of contract lawsuits, Advantage Solutions was faced with the challenge of providing cost-effective and reliable near real-time reports. Their initial attempt to address this issue involved consolidating the business units into a single technology stack. However, after investing $6M in two internal projects that failed to deliver the desired outcome, the company decided to bring in external expertise.\nA consulting firm was hired, proposing a three-year, $30M plan to streamline business processes and technology into a unified approach, aptly named \"one best way\".\n‍\nEmbracing Change: Advantage Solutions' Shift to a Unified Data Warehouse with InfoMagnus.\nThe $30M plan proposed by the consultants was met with skepticism, prompting IT stakeholders at Advantage Solutions to seek an alternative. They turned to InfoMagnus, who proposed a unified data warehouse as a more cost-effective solution.\nThe business requirements were clear-cut:\nA cost-optimized solution that would maintain or reduce operating expenses.\nNear real-time updates of source data reflected in over 120 customer reports.\nA system capable of streaming more than 10 million records daily, including files hundreds of GBs in size.\nRetirement of the aging on-premises SQL data warehouse, which was responsible for over 70% of data volume.\nCompliance with security requirements as stipulated by customer contracts and the Advantage Solutions Security Officer.\nInfoMagnus, an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Partner, took on the challenge and designed, built, deployed, and configured a new data warehouse using Snowflake. This new data warehouse, hosted in AWS, replaced multiple on-premises data warehouses, including an enterprise MSSQL database. The retirement of the MSSQL instance, which accounted for 72% of the volume, resulted in an annual savings of $94,000 on licensing.\nThe architecture of the new solution was as follows:\nData was extracted from various source systems using the third-party tool, Talend.\nThis data was then pushed from Talend into Amazon S3 storage.\nUsing the Bulk Copy command, data was moved into the Snowflake data warehouse hosted in AWS.\nAmazon S3 was chosen for its unlimited storage, timestamping capabilities, and encryption features to ensure data security. Advantage Solutions experienced improved performance and resiliency with AWS, leading to a decision to increase AWS workloads and decrease Azure consumption. The company utilized AWS Direct Connect to replicate data from the on-premises database to the AWS-hosted Snowflake. This strategy facilitated a swift data migration, shaving off a week from the project timeline.\nFrom The Client\nThe elimination of manual processes led to an estimated annual time saving of 12,480 hours within the business team.\n‍\nReaping the Rewards: The Impact of the Unified Data Warehouse on Advantage Solutions.\nThe introduction of the Retail Unified data warehouse brought significant value to Advantage Solutions' business intelligence, internal operations, and customer relations. The consolidation into a single data warehouse facilitated automatic data normalization and established a single source of truth. The AWS architecture underpinning the system enabled continuous updates, leading to near real-time reports and an impressive 86% improvement in performance. The business intelligence team saw a reduction in their support hours by 40% in the first year, freeing up time for new development, including the delivery of 20 enterprise customer dashboards.\nThe business was able to uphold customer trust by delivering comprehensive, near real-time reporting as promised. The elimination of manual processes led to an estimated annual time saving of 12,480 hours within the business team. This newfound time was redirected towards data analysis and the creation of action plans to boost customer Return on Investment (ROI). The ability to access near-real time data also had operational implications. Management gained immediate visibility into completed work, enabling real-time feedback. This led to improved compliance, a 7% increase in overall on-date execution, and a near elimination of non-billable \"fix it\" store visits.\nBut perhaps the most significant impact was on Advantage Solutions' customers. They received the promised reports, and for many, near real-time reporting across all chains and regions was a novel experience. This newfound visibility empowered smarter decisions on the use of merchandising services, leading to improved ROI. As reports were consistently delivered and outages reduced by over 80%, customer trust in Advantage Solutions grew.\n‍\nshare the future\nwant to learn more about how InfoMagnus is changing the technology landscape? reach out!\nLet's Talk\nBy clicking\n“Accept All Cookies”\n, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.

The goals shared a direct correlation–revenue.\nTogether with InfoMagnus, Avalara was able to achieve a path forward by taking disparate databases in marketing, sales, finance and IT and unifying them under a new data warehouse using relevant data from both customer satisfaction efforts and marketing campaigns into one platform.\nWhat We Did\nImplementation of Microsoft SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services)\nMicrosoft SQL Server 2012\nSQL Server Analysis Services\nExcel-based reporting with the use of PowerPivot\nReports and dashboards published through SharePoint\nThe business challenge:\naccurately measure marketing program effectiveness and customer satisfaction.\nAvalara partnered with InfoMagnus to help solve a business challenge both internally within the organization and externally with their customers: marketing department’s wanted to measure the effectiveness of sales promotions, website content, and social media impact on sales performance, while adhering to company's culture of customer satisfaction.\nAt Avalara, entire departments and individual executives are rewarded based on the results of their customer satisfaction scorecard.\nAlthough these challenges were diverse in nature, these two business goals are related through their effect on revenue; more effective marketing programs and higher customer satisfaction produce higher revenue in this software subscription model.\nAccomplishing these business challenges proved to be even more difficult as the data was spread out among dozens of disparate databases in Marketing, Sales, Information Technology, and Finance. The data needed to be unified from Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics GP (ERP) and multiple other systems in order to build analytics and reporting on top of it.\n‍\nReal-Time Data Analysis: How Avalara and InfoMagnus Joined Forces to Create a Centralized Data Warehouse for Extracting, Transforming and Loading Data.\nAvalara partnered with InfoMagnus to create a data warehouse where relevant data from all sources was extracted, transformed, and loaded into one platform. Together, we implemented Master Data Management (MDM) to ensure data integrity throughout the supported systems.\nInfoMagnus automated all steps of extracting data from disparate sources, transforming, loading, and producing reports using the new data platform. We developed analytical and reporting solutions, both in a relational database as well as a big data environment, to demonstrate effectiveness of marketing and sales campaign.\nAlso, customer satisfaction dashboards could now be developed at the department and executive level.\nFrom The Client\n\"The complex data warehouse and analytical system InfoMagnus developed has become our backbone for customer satisfaction and sales trending analytics.\"\n– Kevin Riegelsberger, Chief Strategic Initiatives Officer, Avalara Inc.\n‍\nExploring the Potential of Big Data.\nWith more than 20,000 clients, 6.7 billion transactions processed, $30 billion prepared in taxes, 18 million tax documents managed, and 1,500 employees, the opportunities to capture and analyze customer satisfaction data are exponential and so are the opportunities to measure marketing program effectiveness on over $272 million in sales.\n‍\nThe Impact of Proactive Programs: Examining Avalara's Growth Since Implementing Strategies Five Years Ago.\nAlthough difficult to measure the exact impact, it is important to note that Avalara has grown significantly since these programs were implemented almost 5 years ago.\nRevenue grew from approximately $60 million in 2013 to over $272 million in 2018.\nshare the future\nwant to learn more about how InfoMagnus is changing the technology landscape? reach out!\nLet's Talk\nBy clicking\n“Accept All Cookies”\n, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.

Established players and upstarts alike in this sector face the perennial challenge of harnessing dispersed, siloed data—a Gordian knot that constrains strategic decision-making and stifles innovation.\nRecognizing the pivotal role that data plays not just in everyday operations, but also in carving out future growth trajectories, Envase embarked on an ambitious journey. The mission? Migrate fragmented data from disparate application databases into a centralized Amazon Web Services (AWS) Data Lake. The objective was clear-cut: create a robust, cross-functional reporting platform that could serve as the nerve center for business intelligence and analytics, while transforming and unlocking new cross-platform capabilities, enabling systems to freely exchange data through web hooks.\nBy navigating through the complexities of data consolidation, Envase, in partnership with InfoMagus, aimed to achieve something more sublime than mere operational excellence; the project was a steppingstone toward unlocking new horizons in data monetization and prescriptive analysis, ultimately offering a potent competitive edge.\nLet’s explore the contours of this transformative project, delving into the technical nuances, business imperatives, and the cascading benefits that have placed Envase at the forefront of data-driven business innovation in its industry.\nWhat We Did\nLeveraged AWS Data Lake to centralize and secure diverse data sources across the organization.\nUtilized AWS infrastructure as code for scalable, automated, and version-controlled cloud resource management.\nEmployed AWS-native ETL tools to build robust data pipelines for seamless extraction, transformation, and loading of data.\nIntegrated AWS with Business Intelligence platforms to enable real-time analytics and reporting capabilities.\nBridging Data Islands: Envase's Quest for a Unified Reporting Platform.\nAt the nexus of Envase's digital transformation was a deceptively straightforward aim: construct a unified data ecosystem capable of powering cross-platform analytics and reporting. The project, far from being a mere exercise in IT overhaul, was envisioned as a strategic initiative with ramifications that could reverberate across the organizational hierarchy—from ground-level operations to executive decision-making.\nProject Description\nThe plan was ambitious in scope yet pragmatic in execution: migrate a diverse array of data, residing in multiple applications, into a centralized AWS Data Lake. Once consolidated, this data would be streamlined to fuel a state-of-the-art reporting platform. The aspiration was to not only gain insights into operational efficiency and strategic directions but also set the stage for future data monetization initiatives.\nOverall Business Value\nBy breaking down data silos and creating a harmonized data repository, Envase sought to manifest several layers of business value:\nStrategic Value: The initiative facilitated broader cross-sectional analytics, arming executives with a 360-degree view of operations and strategic pathways.\nOperational Efficiency: With data silos dismantled, departments no longer had to engage in cumbersome data extraction exercises, leading to better resource allocation.\nMonetization Prospects: Unifying the data created the groundwork for future monetization strategies, opening new revenue streams that were previously untapped.\nThus, the AWS Data Lake wasn't merely a technical solution; it was a business catalyst, designed to amplify Envase's market competitiveness and long-term viability.\n‍\nFrom Bottlenecks to Breakthroughs: The Business Imperative for Envase's Data Lake Initiative.\nIn an industry where data is the lifeblood of both operations and competitive strategy, Envase found itself confronting a substantial obstacle: its data lived in disparate, siloed repositories, stifling the organization's ability to share information across platforms, let alone analyze it for actionable insights.\nProblem Statement\nEnvase's information architecture was a labyrinthine network of isolated application databases, each holding critical but compartmentalized data. This lack of cohesion was more than a mere inconvenience. It was a debilitating bottleneck that hindered cross-platform sharing, real-time reporting, and sophisticated analysis. Consequently, departments operated in informational vacuums, leading to sub-optimal decision-making, missed opportunities, and operational inefficiencies.\nBusiness Implications\nThe data fragmentation didn't just pose technical challenges. It had real-world impacts that could be quantified in lost revenue and squandered time. Decision-makers lacked a unified view of operations, affecting strategic planning. Operational teams had to spend significant amounts of time manually extracting and consolidating data for reporting, diminishing productivity. Furthermore, the inability to conduct cross-platform analytics meant Envase was leaving valuable insights—potential game-changers—on the table.\nThe situation was untenable for a company with ambitions to be an industry leader in data-driven decision-making and operational efficiency. Something had to give, and thus was born the initiative to overhaul this fractured data landscape.\n‍\nBuilding the Backbone: The Architecture and Engineering of Envase's AWS Data Lake.\nWhen dealing with intricate data silos that restricted the free flow of information, half-measures wouldn't suffice. Envase understood that a holistic, scalable solution was required to eradicate existing inefficiencies and lay the groundwork for future advancements.\nEstablishing the AWS Data Lake Environment\nThe cornerstone of the technical strategy was the AWS Data Lake, a centralized repository designed to ingest, store, and manage data from varied sources in its native format. This move wasn't just about capacity; it was a nod to the scalability, security, and performance that AWS could offer.\nInfrastructure as Code and Data Pipelines\nTo streamline data movement and transformation, InfoMagnus architects implemented 'Infrastructure as Code'—a programming approach that manages infrastructure through code rather than manual processes. This proved instrumental in the creation and refinement of data pipelines. Specifically, the code facilitated:\nExtraction:\nPipelines were engineered to pull data from an assortment of application databases, each with its unique schema and storage format. In addition to standardizing data, the pipelines were engineered to support web hooks, enhancing data interoperability across multiple systems.\nTransformation: A subsequent layer of pipelines was employed to cleanse, normalize, and standardize this data, prepping it for analytical consumption.\nBI Tool Integration\nInfoMagnus didn't stop at mere data consolidation. Aware that data is only as good as the insights drawn from it, they established connections to Business Intelligence (BI) tools directly from the AWS Data Lake. This move effectively converted the Data Lake from a passive storage entity to an active analytical hub, making data immediately available for strategic interpretation.\nConsultation and Strategy\nKey to the project's success was continuous consultation with client stakeholders to assess reporting and analytics requirements. This collaborative approach ensured that the Data Lake's architecture and subsequent pipelines were meticulously aligned with actual business needs, rather than being a tech-driven afterthought.\nBy marrying cutting-edge technology with a laser-focused understanding of business requirements, Envase was able to create a sophisticated, dynamic data environment, paving the way for cross-functional reporting and analytics.\nMilestones and Metrics: Measuring the Success of Envase's Data Lake Project.\nIn the lexicon of digital transformation, \"outcome\" isn't merely a buzzword but a concrete measure of efficacy and strategic alignment.

Whether they are supporting the clinical, financial or operational areas of a hospital or health system, Epic’s tools are designed to work for today and think for tomorrow.\nEpic supports its clients by surfacing data that enables them to make informed decisions for better management of operations, while arming their clinicians with the information they need to provide smarter care.\nWith the data solution developed by InfoMagnus, a large healthcare provider was able to access actionable information and help improve performance measurement and the efficiency of laboratory services.\nWhat We Did\niLab platform extracts, transforms, and loads data from Epic into a large Oracle database.\nSAP Business Objects Tools are used to simplify and improve data access by creating a metadata structure.\nSAP’s Web Intelligence accesses the metadata to create actionable reports.\nDelivered object storage services via Amazon S3\nIntegration with Epic for a single direction data extract.\nThe business challenge:\nTo improve the efficiency of laboratory services.\nMeasuring performance at a granular-level has been a challenge for this client based on the complexities of “slicing and dicing” data from Epic.\n‍\nUsers often have a difficult time gathering the data they need. They must go through multiple, time-consuming cycles of report generation, make manual adjustments, and calculations to ready the data for analysis.\nIn addition, system performance is degrading based on the continuous increase in the size of the database.\n‍\nData-Driven Insights: InfoMagnus’ iLab Platform Extracts, Transforms and Loads Data From Epic Into a Large Oracle Database.\nInfoMagnus’ solution improves extraction, reporting, and analysis of the necessary data to measure and improve lab performance. The iLab platform extracts, transforms, and loads data from Epic into a large Oracle database.\nSAP Business Objects Tools are used to simplify and improve data access by creating a metadata structure. SAP’s Web Intelligence accesses the metadata to create actionable reports. This solution allows for more detailed data analysis than Discern, the reporting tool provided by Epic.\nAs the database size increases, the Oracle database will be transitioned to Hadoop for better performance. Tableau and PowerBI are also used for Dashboard applications.\nFrom The Client\nInfoMagnus’ solution improves extraction, reporting, and analysis of the necessary data to measure and improve lab performance.\n‍\nOptimized Efficiency: InfoMagnus’ iLab Platform Helps Hospitals and Labs Achieve Improved Data Processing, Analysis and Reporting\niLab has more than 200 users accessing the reporting platform via a web link at 18 hospitals and 33 labs. The system accounts for thousands of patients and tens of thousands of lab tests.\nMajor users are the Regional Lab Director, Lab System Managers, and Lab Data personnel. This project includes general Lab, Blood Bank, and Microbiology labs. There are plans to add more by the end of the year.\n‍\nUnlocking Insights: How InfoMagnus Enabled Access to Actionable Information To Help Improve Performance Measurement and Efficiency.\nThe access to actionable information is helping to improve performance measurement and the efficiency of laboratory services. Reports that took hours to produce now take mere minutes. Specimen turn-around-time is being more accurately measured and reported.\nPerformance can now be measured at the lab location, technician, and device level. Measurement allows leaders to leverage areas of excellence and work on areas needing improvement.\nThis project has also improved the working conditions of lab personnel since broken equipment is found and fixed more rapidly. Since Epic is a leading application in the industry and this data reporting and analysis problem is common, this solution can be implemented for any department running similar health information and EHR technologies.\nshare the future\nwant to learn more about how InfoMagnus is changing the technology landscape? reach out!\nLet's Talk\nBy clicking\n“Accept All Cookies”\n, you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation, analyze site usage, and assist in our marketing efforts.

It’s reshaping how we write code, cutting down the routine and freeing up our team to focus on the more creative and complex challenges we face when developing software solutions for our clients.\nIf you’re a developer and haven’t explored Copilot yet, you might be missing out on what could be the most transformative tool we’ve seen in years.\nWhat is GitHub Copilot?\nFor those unfamiliar, Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant that turns natural language prompts into code. It integrates smoothly with popular IDEs like Visual Studio Code and aims to increase productivity by helping you generate code snippets on the fly.\nThink of it as having a personal coding assistant who understands your needs–well, most of the time… more on that later–and helps speed up your workflow.\nBoost Coding Speed and Efficiency with GitHub Copilot’s AI-Powered Assistance.\nLet’s talk about speed! Copilot doesn't just help you write code faster, it helps you think faster. Whether it's generating boilerplate code, completing routine tasks, or suggesting ways to solve a problem, Copilot is like that extra set of hands every developer wishes they had.\nNeed to write a unit test or crank out some basic scaffolding for a project? Copilot can churn it out in seconds. And no, it’s not just copying Stack Overflow answers—it’s smart, it learns from your project, and it adapts to your coding style.\nOne of my colleagues summed it up well by saying, “It’s like having a copilot who takes over the easy stuff, so you can focus on steering the ship.” And honestly, I couldn’t agree more.\nEnhance Developer Creativity and Problem-Solving with GitHub Copilot’s AI Suggestions.\nWe’ve all been there… staring at a screen, trying to figure out the best way to implement a feature or fix a bug. Copilot excels at providing suggestions that help get the creative juices flowing. It might not always nail the solution on the first try, but it often gets you 80% of the way there, leaving you to do what developers love most: tweak, refine, and perfect.\nThis boost in creativity is especially helpful when you’re stuck on something small, like figuring out a function or writing a script. Copilot offers fresh perspectives, helping you think outside the box. It’s like brainstorming with another developer, except this one stays focused and keeps you on track!\nLeverage GitHub Copilot as a Learning Tool to Master New Languages and Best Practices.\nA surprising benefit of Copilot is its potential as a learning tool.\nIf you’re venturing into a language or framework you're less familiar with, Copilot acts as a guide. It suggests methods, functions, and patterns that you might not have thought of, all while keeping things aligned with best practices. It’s like having a mentor who quietly nudges you in the right direction while you work.\nPlus, it’s a great way to stay up-to-date with coding standards. Since it learns from public repositories and the code you’re working on, Copilot tends to reflect current best practices.\nIt’s almost like having an ever-evolving textbook that writes itself.\nEmbrace GitHub Copilot’s Imperfections as It Learns and Grows Smarter with Every Use\nNow, let’s be real. Copilot isn’t perfect. Sometimes it makes a suggestion that’s not quite right, or it offers a solution that might work, but isn’t optimal for your specific case.\nBut here’s the thing. It’s constantly learning. And as more developers use it and feed it data, Copilot will only get smarter and more intuitive.\nSure, it might offer a line of code that makes you scratch your head for a second, but let’s be honest–so does that coworker who swears by regex for everything.\nThe point is, even when Copilot doesn’t hit the nail on the head, it still sparks ideas and often leads you down the right path faster than you’d get there on your own.\nYour Coding Partner for Streamlined Development and Creative Problem-Solving.\nAt the end of the day, Copilot is more than just a tool–it’s a partner in code. It’s there to help you with the tedious parts of development, freeing you up to focus on the bigger, more interesting challenges. It’s not about replacing developers; it’s about empowering us to do more in less time.\nAnd let’s face it: anything that helps us write fewer boilerplate functions and unit tests is worth celebrating. So, if you haven’t already, give Copilot a try. You might just find that it’s the coding buddy you never knew you needed.\nMaster Modern Software Development & Security with GitHub Copilot Workshops.\nIf you’re curious to see how GitHub Copilot can transform your workflow, InfoMagnus offers hands-on workshops designed to help you and your team unlock its full potential.\nOur sessions cover everything from setup to advanced tips, ensuring you can integrate Copilot seamlessly into your development process.\nWhether you're looking to boost productivity, streamline tasks, or explore new ways of coding, these workshops offer practical insights tailored to your needs.

One of the critical aspects of this adaptation is the migration of code repositories and development workflows.\nGitHub, as one of the leading platforms for version control and collaboration, is often the destination for such migrations. Understanding migrations is the first step in ensuring a smooth transition that preserves the integrity of your codebase and minimizes disruptions to your development process.\nMigrations to GitHub entail the transfer of not just code, but also the history, branches, tags, and other metadata associated with a repository. For businesses, this can also include the migration of issues, pull requests, and wiki pages. This is crucial for maintaining continuity and ensuring that the historical context of the development process is not lost.\nAdditionally, migrations often involve the integration of third-party services and tools, which requires careful planning and execution.\nUnderstanding migrations also involves recognizing the potential challenges and risks involved. These can range from technical issues such as data loss or corruption, to more human-centric challenges like adapting to new workflows and tools.\nFor businesses, mitigating these risks through thorough planning, testing, and communication is essential. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive overview of GitHub migrations for businesses, offering insights and best practices to facilitate a successful transition.\n‍\nWhat Types of Migrations are Specific to GitHub?\nA migration is typically undertaken when an organization decides to move their software development workflows to GitHub, either from another\nversion control system\nor from a self-hosted system. The goal is to improve collaboration, streamline workflows, and take advantage of the features and integrations offered by GitHub.\nSome of the typical migrations include:\nCode Repository Migration:\nThis involves moving a codebase, its history, and related data from one version control system to another, such as from Bitbucket or GitLab to GitHub. This can also include the migration of issues, pull requests, and wiki pages, preserving the historical context and continuity of the development process.\nDatabase Migration:\nIn the context of GitHub, this could involve moving databases that are associated with the applications being version-controlled on GitHub. This may be necessary if the database schemas or data need to be version-controlled along with the application code.\nCloud Migration:\nThis involves moving from a self-hosted version control system to a cloud-based system like GitHub. This comes into play if an organization wants to reduce the overhead of maintaining their own version control servers and take advantage of the scalability and collaboration features offered by GitHub.\n‍\nThe Benefits of Migrations: How Migrations can increase productivity, ROI and more.\nMigrations to GitHub can offer significant benefits, they should be approached with careful planning and consideration. It's important to assess the readiness of the team, the suitability of the tool for the organization's needs, and the potential costs and challenges of the migration process. With the right preparation and approach, a migration can be a strategic move that enhances an organization's software development capabilities and outcomes.\nIncreased Productivity\n‍\nOne of the primary benefits of migrating to GitHub is the potential for increased productivity.\nGitHub's intuitive interface, extensive documentation, and wide array of features can streamline workflows and make collaboration more efficient. Features like pull requests, issue tracking, and project boards can help teams stay organized and focused. However, it's important to note that these benefits can only be realized if the team is willing and able to adapt to new workflows and tools. There may be a learning curve involved, particularly for teams that are not familiar with Git or GitHub.\nImproved Collaboration\n‍\nGitHub is designed to facilitate collaboration, with features that allow for code reviews, comments on commits, and more.\nThis can lead to better code quality and a more cohesive team. Keep in mind that these collaboration features require a certain level of discipline and good communication habits from the team. Without these, there's a risk of miscommunication or confusion.\nIntegration with Other Tools\n‍\nGitHub integrates with a wide range of other tools, from continuous integration servers to project management tools.\nThis can help to create a seamless development workflow, reducing the need for context-switching and making it easier to automate tasks. However, setting up and maintaining these integrations can require time and technical expertise.\nIncreased ROI\nBy streamlining workflows and improving collaboration, GitHub can help to reduce the time and effort required to develop and maintain software.\nThis can lead to cost-savings and a higher return on investment (ROI) over time. It's important to factor in the costs of the migration itself, including any downtime, the potential need for training, and the time required to set up and configure the new environment.\nAccess to a Large Community\n‍\nGitHub hosts a large community of developers, which can be a valuable resource for learning and problem-solving. Again, it's important to be aware of the potential security implications of hosting code on a public platform, even if the repositories are private.\nConsistency and Standardization\n‍\nMigrating to GitHub can help to standardize workflows across an organization, making it easier to onboard new team members and maintain consistency across projects. Although effective, this standardization may not suit all teams or projects, and there may be resistance from team members who prefer different tools or workflows.\n‍\nDissecting Success: The Anatomy of a Successful GitHub Migration\nA successful migration is a multi-faceted process that requires careful planning, clear communication, and meticulous execution. Here's a breakdown of the key components.\nBusiness Requirements:\nBefore embarking on a migration, it's crucial to clearly define the business requirements.

The partnership and offerings of AWS, like the AWS MAP program, serve as a roadmap to further success and innovation. Whether your business is looking to scale, innovate, or secure its processes, AWS and particularly the AWS MAP program can be the catalyst to unlock new horizons. Let's dive in and see why the AWS MAP initiative is the right play for any business looking to move to the cloud.\n‍\nOptimizing Cloud Migration: An Introduction to AWS MAP and the InfoMagnus Partnership with Pacific Dental Services.\nAWS understands that the initial step most organizations take toward cloud adoption involves migrating away from their existing data centers. To facilitate a smooth and successful migration, the AWS Migration Acceleration Program (MAP) offers a host of advantageous features to its customers, including:\nA prescriptive, step-by-step guide tailored for migrating workloads to AWS.\nSpecialized AWS services engineered specifically to facilitate smooth migrations.\nFinancial support from AWS, earmarked for qualified AWS partners to assist customers throughout the critical migration phases of Assessment, Mobilization, and Migration itself.\nPacific Dental Services (PDS) chose to collaborate with InfoMagnus, an AWS Advanced Tier Partner, to leverage their expertise during the AWS MAP Assessment phase. PDS elected to undertake an AWS MAP assessment as they recognized the crucial role AWS could play in hosting their complex technical stack. They understood that to navigate the intricate migration landscape successfully, the guidance of the MAP program, and a qualified partner like InfoMagnus, was essential.\nAnother incentive was the lower barrier to entry; the program allowed busy IT professionals at PDS to delegate migration assessment activities to AWS Partner InfoMagnus, thus freeing internal resources for other strategic initiatives.\n‍\nGuiding Success: AWS MAP's Comprehensive Approach to Workload Migrations, Backed by Proven Strategies and Financial Support.\nAWS MAP is a prescriptive guide for workload migrations to AWS. This guidance was developed internally by AWS after tens of thousands of successful migrations. The guidance has proven effective as it provides motivation and a comprehensive approach to migration. Additionally, AWS will provide funding for AWS partners to assist with the migration efforts. The funding varies by phases and is distributed after completion of milestones.\nAssess Phase: During this phase, a business case was created by InfoMagnus leveraging AWS services for inventory discovery, total cost of ownership (TCO) comparison, and workshops to assess PDS’s migration readiness. This resulted in a case for change that opened the next phase of migration, including:\nMobilization Phase:\nAWS reviews the business case from the Assess, and approved InfoMagnus to proceed with the Mobilization Phase. This phase also included AWS funding to offset the customer’s cost of the work of InfoMagnus. This phase is to define how the migration will proceed.\n‍\nMigration Phase:\nResources are moved to AWS. They are tagged with a specific code that lets AWS track the services consumed, which then returns money back to the customer in the form of credits.\n‍\nPreparation Meets Opportunity: A Comprehensive Guide to AWS MAP Assessment with Insights from the Pacific Dental Case.\nEmbarking on an AWS MAP Assessment is not a task to be taken lightly. It requires meticulous preparation, alignment, and understanding of the platform. From setting aside dedicated time for the team to engage in the process to ensuring executive sponsorship, every detail matters.\nThe success of the MAP is contingent on a well-coordinated effort that includes a one-day Migration Readiness Assessment (MRA) workshop, requiring participation from a broad spectrum of the customer's experts. In the case of Pacific Dental, the challenges were multifaceted, ranging from a busy staff slow to adopt new technologies to a specific need for AWS expertise.\nLet's take a look at the essential elements to prepare before embarking on an AWS MAP Assessment, highlighting the unique requirements and challenges faced by Pacific Dental, and how these shaped the assessment preparation. Whether it's understanding the AWS platform or creating an AWS account, every step is crucial in ensuring a smooth and successful migration.\n‍\nEssential Preparations for a Successful AWS MAP Assessment:\n‍\n‍\n‍\nAllocate Team Time:\nThe AWS MAP process requires time commitment from your team to ensure everyone is assigned tasks, due dates, and remains focused on the final outcome. An integral part of the MAP Assessment is the Migration Readiness Assessment (MRA), a one-day workshop involving a cross-functional set of experts from the customer side—spanning strategy to infrastructure. Early commitment to the MRA is crucial for successful migration.\nExecutive Sponsorship:\nA vital component to the success of any MAP is having an executive sponsor within the customer organization. This individual sets priorities and provides leadership, significantly accelerating the MAP process. An effective executive sponsor ensures that the migration project maintains momentum and doesn't stagnate due to shifts in team focus.\nBasic AWS Understanding and Account Setup:\nTo proceed with the MAP Assessment, customers must have at least a rudimentary understanding of the AWS platform and set up an AWS account. AWS offers specialized services that assist in asset discovery, inventory management, and business case development, all of which require customer-side access for configuration and setup.\nSpecifics of the Pacific Dental Case: Challenges and Unique Requirements\nWhen Pacific Dental Services embarked on their journey to the cloud through the AWS Migration Acceleration Program (MAP), they faced distinct challenges: a busy staff, cautious tech adoption, and a gap in AWS expertise. The partnership with InfoMagnus, an AWS Partner, proved to be instrumental in navigating these hurdles, offering invaluable guidance and skill throughout the migration assessment process.\nBusy Staff:\nThe staff at Pacific Dental were often occupied with other responsibilities, making the role of an AWS Partner like InfoMagnus even more critical.\nSlow Adoption:\nThe organization had a cautious approach toward new technologies, making the guidance from the AWS MAP program and a knowledgeable partner invaluable.\nExpertise Gap:\nThere was a clear need for AWS expertise, emphasizing the importance of a qualified partner in the assessment process.\n‍\nUnlocking Successful Cloud Migration: How the Migration Readiness Assessment and InfoMagnus' Expert Use of MPA Shape Your AWS Journey.\nThe migration readiness assessment helps to identify gaps along the six dimensions of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework: business, process, people, platform, operations, and security. This assessment identifies the capabilities required in the migration and build a TCO model for your migration project.\nAWS provides several services that gather data about the servers to be migrated and to organize and plan the migration of the servers and applications. InfoMagnus used the Migration Portfolio Assessment (MPA) tool. This tool is not available to AWS customers. The MPA can only be used by an AWS employee or an approved partner.\nFeatures of the MPA Service:\nManage portfolio data\nImport and validate portfolio data with a flexible import workflow and customizable data validation rules.\nCollect Portfolio Data:\nRequest and collect application, server and database data from the subject matter experts via customizable questionnaires.\nEstimate AWS Usage Cost:\nCompute: EC2, VMware Cloud on AWS\nStorage: EBS, EFS, S3, Glacier\nDatabase: RDS\nNetwork cost estimation.\nIT labor and support cost estimation.\nPrioritize Applications:\nRank applications based on the business and technical drivers of the migration.\nCompare AWS and On-Premises Costs:\nSee detailed cost and cash flow comparison between AWS and on-premises analysis in both numeric and graphical formats.\nCreate Application Groups:\nCreate application groups by analyzing dependencies to understand which applications must migrate together.\nEstimate Migration Project Cost:\n‍\nEstimate the cost of an on-premises to AWS migration project.\nBuild a Migration Wave Plan:\nGenerate a wave plan for application groups. MPA helps to consider an application’s priority, data collection status and dependencies so that migration can start sooner with fewer potential roadblocks.\nRecommend Migration Strategies:\nRecommend the migration strategy (Rehost, Replatform, Rearchitect) for the servers and applications in the portfolio.\nVisualize Portfolio:\nVisualize the portfolio data through customizable charts.\nAWS does provide several equivalent tools that customers will find in the AWS Portal.\n‍\nOvercoming Challenges with Positivity: How PDS Succeeded in the Assess Phase of the AWS MAP Journey.\nPDS is a great customer to work with. They immediately understood the value of MAP. With a small, 6-week window to get through the assessment, there were several interruptions that slowed the assessment. These interruptions ranged from vacation time to competing interests from other projects.\nThe simplest was to get the inventory of servers that need to be migrated, while it was more difficult to complete the assessment of PDS organizational readiness for the migration. Still, with a positive attitude and a prescriptive process, the Assess phase was a success.\n‍\nUnlocking the Power of Readiness Reviews: Post-Assessment Insights for a Seamless Cloud Migration.\nThe readiness review, conducted as part of the post-assessment analysis, offers organizations a comprehensive snapshot of their preparedness for cloud migration. This review leads to three fundamental outcomes: gauging an organization's current stage in its cloud journey, pinpointing areas of strength and weakness, and formulating an actionable plan to address those gaps.\nFurthermore, the process fosters team alignment, reveals best practices to be scaled, and minimizes disruptive roadblocks, thereby setting the stage for a more streamlined and efficient cloud migration.\nThree outcomes from a readiness review:\nAn understanding of where an organization is in its cloud journey.\nIdentified areas of strength and weakness from a cloud-readiness perspective.\nAn action plan to resolve the identified gaps, so the organization can migrate at scale without having to pause to solve foundational issues.\nAlignment and consensus building within the team.\nIdentification of best practices within the organization that can be leveraged and scaled.\nA reduction in roadblocks that can disrupt progress.\n‍\nGuiding the Way: Key Takeaways from Pacific Dental's Successful AWS MAP Assessment with InfoMagnus.\nNavigating the complexities of cloud migration can be daunting, but Pacific Dental's experience with the AWS Migration Acceleration Program (MAP) assessment serves as an illuminating case study. Not only did the MAP assessment justify the project's disruptions through AWS-provided funding, but it also garnered crucial customer focus on the advantages of migration. Partnering with InfoMagnus allowed Pacific Dental to fully leverage AWS capabilities without having to become experts themselves.\nIn this examination, we'll look into how this partnership fueled Pacific Dental's migration success and reveal key lessons other organizations can apply for their own cloud journeys.\nHow the MAP assessment impacted Pacific Dental's migration to AWS.\nThe MAP assessment is a great tool for driving activity and commitment from a customer. The customer found that funding provided by AWS justified the disruptions, while getting them focused on the advantages of migrating to AWS.\nInfoMagnus assisted the customer with their journey by providing expertise and guidance so that the customer did not need to be an expert in AWS to immediately leverage the advantages provided by the cloud platform.\nKey learnings that other companies can take away from Pacific Dental's experience.\nAWS has provided the MAP to provide prescriptive guidance and funding to improve the success of a migration within a reasonable timeframe. InfoMagnus has learned that although these enticements will make the journey easier, it is important to secure commitment from the customer to provide the right people at the right time. This can be difficult considering the competing projects and deliveries that most customers are also focused upon.\nIt is key to identify one or more champions at the customer who will work from within to encourage participation from stakeholders and subject matters experts so that delays are minimized and the assessment is complete.\nready to build your future?\nLet's Talk!\nRead More From InfoMagnus.\nCase Study\nInfoMagnus helps Captis Intelligence master cloud migration with AWS\nInsights\n8 ways to collaborate like a pro on GitHub\nInsights\nNeed to get your team trained in GitHub? 6 requirements you should look for.\nInsights\nGitHub migrations: Learn the process, benefits, and strategies for a seamless transition to boost productivity.\nCase Study\nInfoMagnus helps Captis Intelligence master cloud migration with AWS\nInsights\n8 ways to collaborate like a pro on GitHub\nInsights\nNeed to get your team trained in GitHub? 6 requirements you should look for.\nInsights\nGitHub migrations: Learn the process, benefits, and strategies for a seamless transition to boost productivity.\nWe love knowledge-sharing.

Their groundbreaking product, Solve A Crime, attracted a global community of over 20 million users across 30,000 locations nationwide. However, with scaling demands and the need for agility, the team recognized the urgency to migrate their complex architecture to a more streamlined, reliable environment. Enter Amazon Web Services (AWS), whose plethora of tools not only aligned with the project's multifaceted needs but also set the stage for future innovations.\n‍\nAddressing Technological Inadequacies to Enhance Crime Solving.\nLaw enforcement agencies are buckling under the strains of limited resources and an ever-increasing volume of unsolved crimes. Captis Intelligence sought to bridge this gap with their Solveacrime.com (SAC) platform. However, they encountered challenges tied to performance, scalability, and operational overhead in their existing IT setup.\nThe conundrum led them to reconsider their existing infrastructure and pave the way for an extensive migration to AWS, aiming to optimize both operational efficiencies and user engagement.\n‍\nThe AWS Migration Journey.\nThe move to AWS was far from a mere transfer of assets—it was a full-scale digital transformation, optimized to exploit AWS's vast, interconnected landscape of services. This initiative not only streamlined existing operations but propelled Captis into a new echelon of scalability and performance. The following details everything this multi-layered migration consisted of, while revealing how each component was reconceptualized to resonate with AWS's state-of-the-art offerings.\nDNS Transformation: From GoDaddy to Route 53\nThe initial phase of migration involved transitioning the Domain Name System (DNS) from GoDaddy to AWS Route 53. The move wasn't merely a change of platform; it was a strategic decision to benefit from Route 53's superior routing capabilities and to centralize services under the AWS ecosystem.\nContent Delivery Overhaul: Cloudflare to Cloudfront\nThe quest for enhanced content distribution led the team to swap Cloudflare for AWS CloudFront. This switch facilitated better integration with other AWS services and delivered content to end-users with lower latency.\nNetwork and Load Distribution: Migrating from Azure to AWS Elastic Load Balancers\nWhile Azure had offered a competent load-balancing solution, Elastic Load Balancers provided a more dynamic and flexible approach, allowing the team to distribute incoming application or network traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances.\nApplication and Data Migration\nThe core API servers, previously hosted on Azure and a private cloud, were migrated to EC2 instances. Storage systems underwent a similar transition to AWS S3. These shifts dramatically streamlined the platform's architecture and simplified management operations.\nData Persistence: MySQL and Mongo Atlas\nTo ensure optimal database management, MySQL databases were migrated from Azure and private clouds to AWS RDS, while Mongo Atlas was hosted via EC2 instances. This dual migration offered a more efficient and consolidated data management solution.\nDeployment and Monitoring: Atlassian/JFrog to CodeDeploy and Dynatrace\nThe software deployment process was overhauled from Atlassian/JFrog to AWS CodeDeploy, offering a more integrated environment for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). Monitoring was also elevated by migrating to Dynatrace, enabling detailed performance metrics.\nSpecialized Services: Text Indexing and Face Recognition\nText indexing tasks previously managed by legacy systems were migrated to AWS Elasticsearch, while face recognition technology transitioned from private solutions to AWS Rekognition. These specialized services benefited from AWS's proven scale and reliability.\nResults: Realizing the AWS Advantage\nPost-migration, the SAC platform has seen a significant reduction in operational complexities, latency, and costs. With AWS's robust set of tools, Captis Intelligence has successfully been able to focus on their core mission: reducing crime and enhancing public safety.\n‍\nTransforming Crime-Solving: How AWS Migration Elevates Public Safety.\nThe migration to AWS has been a calculated but necessary evolution for Captis Intelligence and InfoMagnus. It has allowed them to transcend traditional limitations and redefine the scope of community-driven crime-solving platforms. Today, they stand as a testament to the transformative power of well-executed IT migration strategies, equipped with a flexible, scalable AWS architecture that is ready to tackle future challenges.\nThis AWS migration journey is more than a case study—it’s a blueprint for organizations aiming to strategically align their technological infrastructure with overarching business goals.\nready to build your future?\nLet's Talk!\nRead More From InfoMagnus.\nCase Study\nInfoMagnus helps Captis Intelligence master cloud migration with AWS\nInsights\n8 ways to collaborate like a pro on GitHub\nInsights\nNeed to get your team trained in GitHub? 6 requirements you should look for.\nInsights\nGitHub migrations: Learn the process, benefits, and strategies for a seamless transition to boost productivity.\nCase Study\nInfoMagnus helps Captis Intelligence master cloud migration with AWS\nInsights\n8 ways to collaborate like a pro on GitHub\nInsights\nNeed to get your team trained in GitHub? 6 requirements you should look for.\nInsights\nGitHub migrations: Learn the process, benefits, and strategies for a seamless transition to boost productivity.\nWe love knowledge-sharing.

Moreover, GitHub is not just a tool for collaboration, but also a platform for continuous learning and development. Developers can explore open-source projects, learn from their peers, and improve their coding skills. A good training partner can guide developers to leverage these opportunities, fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement.\nThe future of software development is increasingly intertwined with tools like GitHub – this is evidenced by Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub for a staggering $7.5 billion in 2018. By investing in effective GitHub training, organizations are not just enhancing their current operations, but are also preparing their teams for the future of software development. As we dive into the top six things to look for in a GitHub training partner, we'll explore how the right choice can help organizations maximize the benefits and set their teams up for success.\n‍\nUnlocking GitHub: The Indispensable Role of Expertise and Experience in Your Training Partner.\nWhen it comes to mastering GitHub, there's no substitute for expertise and experience. It's not just about knowing the basics—it's about understanding the platform inside and out. And who better to guide your team on this journey than a training partner who's been there, done that, and got the Octocat t-shirt?\nAn experienced trainer has been in the thick of it. They've wrestled with the challenges, cracked the problems, and learned the nitty-gritty of GitHub. This means they can dish out practical, real-world examples that bring abstract concepts to life. They can also share insider tips and tricks that you won't find in any guidebook. This kind of insight is like gold dust. It gives your team a behind-the-scenes tour of GitHub, leading to a deeper, richer understanding of the platform.\nWhat’s more, trainers with top-notch expertise can customize the training to fit your team’s needs. They know what skills are crucial, what's good to know, and what's just fluff. They can zero in on what matters to your team, making the training more targeted and efficient. Plus, they can tackle those tricky questions head-on, turning stumbling blocks into steppingstones.\nLastly, a training partner with a solid track record brings credibility to the table. Your team will be more likely to engage with the training if they respect the trainer's knowledge and skills. They'll listen, ask questions, and participate actively, leading to a more dynamic and effective learning experience.\n‍\nTailoring Success: The Power of Customizable Training Programs in GitHub.\nWith tech training, one size definitely doesn't fit all. Every team has its unique needs, strengths, and goals. That's why customizable training programs are not just beneficial—they're essential. And when it comes to GitHub training, this becomes even more critical.\nLet's talk about relevance. A customizable training program can be tailored to fit your team’s specific requirements. Whether your folks are non-developers, developers, administrators, or involved in migration and implementation, a tailored program can address their specific needs and challenges. This makes the training more relevant, engaging, and effective.\nA customizable program can adapt to your team's pace and style of learning. Some people might grasp new concepts quickly, while others might need a bit more time. Some might prefer hands-on workshops, while others might learn better through discussion or self-study. A good training partner can tweak the program to suit these different learning styles, ensuring that everyone gets the most out of the training.\nAs your team becomes more proficient in GitHub, the training can level up too, introducing more advanced concepts and techniques. This keeps the training challenging and relevant, helping your team continue to develop their skills and knowledge.\n‍\nLeading the Charge: The Pivotal Role of the Trainer in GitHub.\nIn the world of GitHub training, the trainer isn't just a guide—they're the linchpin of the whole operation. They're the ones who can turn a good training program into a transformative experience. Let's break down why the role of the trainer is so crucial.\nA trainer is more than just an expert—they're a leader. They're responsible for leading your team through the complexities of GitHub, moderating discussions, and building moments of reflection. They're the ones who can inspire your team to embrace change and strive for continuous improvement.\nThe trainer is also a mentor: to share their expertise, answer questions, and provide guidance. They can help your team navigate challenges, overcome roadblocks, and learn from their mistakes. This kind of one-on-one attention can make a huge difference in your team's learning journey.\nThe trainer is a communicator. They need to be able to explain complex concepts in a way that's easy to understand. They also need to communicate what's expected from the training in a clear and professional way. This ensures that everyone is on the same page and knows what to aim for.\nA trainer can also be viewed as a role model. They set the standard for what it means to be proficient in GitHub. They demonstrate the skills, attitudes, and behaviors that lead to success. By setting a positive example, they can inspire your team to reach beyond what they thought was possible with complete confidence.\n‍\nLearning by Doing: The Power of Hands-On Learning Opportunities in GitHub Training.\nHands-on training can help facilitate the difference between knowing about GitHub and knowing how to use GitHub.\nHands-on learning is all about doing. It's about getting your hands dirty, making mistakes, and learning from them. It's about applying what you've learned to real-world situations. This kind of experiential learning can help your team understand GitHub on a deeper level, making the training more effective and engaging.\nIt can boost confidence. When your team gets to practice using GitHub, they get to see their skills in action. They get to see their progress, solve problems, and overcome challenges. This can give them the confidence to use GitHub in their day-to-day work.\nThis can also lead to different learning styles. Not everyone learns best by listening to a lecture or reading a manual. Some people learn best by doing. By providing hands-on learning opportunities, a good training partner can ensure that everyone in your team gets the most out of the workshop.\nAnd finally, hands-on learning can make the training more enjoyable. Let's face it—learning by doing can be a lot more fun than learning by listening or reading. And when your team enjoys the training, they're more likely to engage with it and retain what they've learned.\n‍\nBeyond the Training: The Game-Changing Impact of Post-Training Support.\nTraining doesn't end when the workshops do. That's where post-training support comes into play. It's the extra mile that can make all the difference in your team's proficiency.\nPost-training support is about reinforcing what's been learned. It's about helping your team apply their new skills and knowledge in the real world. This kind of ongoing support can help cement the knowledge gained, making it more likely to stick and be applied effectively.\nIt’s also about overcoming the forgetting curve—the brain's natural tendency to forget information that isn't being used. By providing regular reminders and opportunities to practice, post-training support can help your team retain what they've learned and keep their GitHub skills sharp.\nThe ability to reach-out provides a safety net for your team. It gives your team the confidence to apply their new skills, knowing that they have someone to turn to if they hit a roadblock. This can boost their confidence and encourage them to explore and make the most of GitHub.\nFinally, post-training support is about continuous improvement. It's about helping your team keep up with the latest features and best practices in GitHub, ensuring that their skills remain up-to-date and relevant.\n‍\nDecoding Success: The Significance of Track Record and Reviews in Choosing Your GitHub Training Partner.\nA training partner's track record is a testament to their experience and success. It shows that they've been in the game for a while and have a history of delivering results. When evaluating a training partner's track record, look for evidence of successful outcomes with previous clients. Have they helped other teams achieve their goals? Have they supported client success? A proven track record can give you confidence in the training partner's ability to deliver.\nReviews provide insights into the training partner's performance from the people who know best—their previous clients. They can tell you about the quality of the training, the effectiveness of the trainer, and the overall satisfaction with the training experience. When evaluating reviews, look for common themes. Are clients consistently praising the training partner for their expertise, support, or teaching methods? Are there any recurring criticisms? Reviews can give you a glimpse into what it's like to work with the training partner.\nBoth track record and reviews can indicate the training partner's reliability and credibility. They show that the training partner has a history of meeting or exceeding expectations and that they've earned the trust of their clients. This can give you peace of mind that the training partner will deliver on their promises.\n‍\nSealing the Deal: The Final Word on Choosing Your Ideal Training Partner.\nChoosing the right training partner is about more than just ticking boxes—it's about finding a partner who can provide expert-led training designed to educate, prepare, and deliver GitHub services. It's about finding a partner who can leverage exclusive resources to upskill your team and provide deep-dive training across GitHub Core, Migrations, Advanced Security, Advanced Actions, and more. It's about finding a partner who can deliver hands-on consulting, expert-led training, and workshops with GitHub.\nAt InfoMagnus, we’ve help hundreds of enterprise clients do all this and more.

To build better software faster, organizations are increasingly turning to GitHub as the foundation for developer collaboration.\nGitHub's flexible platform hosts code repositories, manages revisions, and connects contributors across the development lifecycle. While powerful on its own, GitHub's value expands exponentially when integrated with other platforms and tools.\nFrom work tracking to CI/CD pipelines, code quality to communication apps, integrations enhance visibility, automation, and analytics. Seamlessly bridging GitHub activity across your technology stack unlocks game-changing efficiencies. But critical integrations that solve specific problems beat generic all-in-one solutions.\nThis article explores the benefits of smart GitHub integrations for optimizing workflows, speeding delivery, raising quality, and informing decisions. Follow our guide to amplify your business through targeted GitHub connections that meet the needs of both developers and the broader organization.\n‍\nConnecting Systems and Unlocking Value.\nOrganizations rely on software to deliver value, engage customers, and streamline operations.\nDeveloping software internally requires efficient collaboration between teams. GitHub has become the de facto platform for software collaboration, with over 73 million developers building on GitHub. Integrating GitHub workflows into existing business tools unlocks major benefits through seamless collaboration, automation, visibility, and data-driven insights. Here are a handful of ways integrations can benefit your organization.\nSeamless workflows:\nIntegrations allow teams to incorporate GitHub without disrupting existing tools and processes. For example, linking GitHub with Jira or Trello enables teams to connect issues with code changes. This improves traceability. Studies show development teams experience\na 22% increase in efficiency\nfrom connecting project management with version control.\nVisibility:\nGitHub integrations provide greater visibility into developer activity. Managers can track pull requests, monitor progress on key initiatives, and get notified when high priority issues are updated. Lack of visibility into developer productivity can result in missed deadlines. Integrations solve this through timely notifications and project dashboards.\nAutomation:\nTedious tasks can be automated based on GitHub events, saving teams significant time. Workflows like CI/CD, code scanning, and documentation generation can be triggered automatically.\nAccording to Gartner\n, teams leveraging CI/CD workflows ship code 46 times more frequently and have 440 times faster lead times.\nInsights:\nIntegrations enable data-driven decisions by capturing key metrics from the development process. Managers gain insights into cycle times, team velocity, defect rates, and technical debt. This allows them to identify bottlenecks, improve processes, and measure ROI on initiatives.\nOne survey showed 83% of IT leaders\nleverage application and code analytics to drive higher business performance.\n‍\nBeyond Coding: Deep Dives into GitHub Integration Types and Tools.\nGitHub integrations empower teams to build better software by connecting critical tools to collaborative coding. For example, traceability links between Jira tickets and code changes allowed Acme Inc to rapidly respond when a customer reported a bug caused by a last-minute requirement change.\nWhile the possibilities are nearly endless, integrations generally fall into five key categories: project management, CI/CD, code quality, communication, and analytics.\nIntegrating GitHub activity into these critical systems unlocks major benefits like enhanced traceability, automated deployment pipelines, centralized notifications, and data-driven insights.\nBelow are some of the popular integrations in each category that showcase how they help optimize workflows, increase visibility, and boost productivity across software projects and organizations.\nProject Management:\nIntegrations with\nJira\n,\nTrello\n,\nAsana\nand other tools allow linking issues/tickets to code changes. This connects planning with implementation. An advanced benefit is traceability – teams can trace code back to requirements and tickets to understand the impact of changes. According to one survey, only 19% of developers have full traceability currently.\nCI/CD Pipelines:\nIntegrations like\nJenkins\n,\nCircleCI\nand\nTravisCI\nautomate build, test and deployment steps. An open source option many don't know about is\nDrone.io\nwhich integrates natively with GitHub and uses Docker to simplify build environments. Advanced pipelines can enable progressive delivery by incrementally rolling out to larger sets of users to reduce risk.\nCode Quality:\nSonarQube\n,\nCode Climate\nand other tools integrate to check code style, security, duplication and more. This helps enforce quality standards and best practices. A lesser-known benefit is the ability to track technical debt over time. This is invaluable for planning refactoring work.\nCommunication:\nSlack and Microsoft Teams enable notifications about repository events. An innovative integration is\nCodeStream\n– it allows commenting directly in the code. This ties conversations to specific parts of the codebase to improve context.\nAnalytics:\nMetabase\n,\nDatadog\nand and\nCodacy\nenable data-driven decisions by capturing key metrics from software development. These tools provide visibility into team productivity, cycle times for issues, code change frequency, defect rates, and technical debt.\nAdvanced options can even offer automated code reviews and quality analysis, along with tracking annotations over time. This gives engineering leaders rich insights into bottlenecks, quality trends, and the long-term maintenance needs of the codebase. With the right data, organizations can optimize processes, improve planning, and measure the ROI of initiatives.\nWhether it’s supercharging agile practices, enabling continuous delivery, improving code quality, enhancing visibility, or leveraging analytics, GitHub integrations provide tangible benefits for engineering and business stakeholders alike.\nThe key is choosing the right integrations that solve pain points within an organization's specific toolchain and workflows. While the possibilities are vast, starting small and building up GitHub connections over time is recommended.\n‍\nStrategic Implementation of GitHub Integrations.\nWhile GitHub integrations offer a plethora of advantages, such as automation and collaboration, they necessitate meticulous planning and governance to fully realize their potential. Businesses must conduct a comprehensive evaluation of several factors, including capabilities, data security, access controls, change management, and scalability, before implementing integrations on a wider scale.\nCapabilities Needed:\nUnderstanding the specific pain points that integrations can address and identifying the most impactful capabilities for your workflows is paramount. An audit by OpsRamp found that a staggering 67% of IT teams fail to utilize even half of their available tool integrations. This underscores the importance of fully leveraging your existing technology stack before considering expansion.\nData Security:\nData security is a critical concern when implementing third-party integrations. A survey by nVisium revealed that 57% of companies have suffered a breach via a third-party vendor. It's essential to meticulously assess access levels and data sharing protocols, enforcing least privilege permissions, and maintaining rigorous audit logs to mitigate risks.\nAccess Controls:\nImplementing robust controls around credential management and authorization is vital. Tools like\nHashiCorp Vault\ncan provide secrets management, ensuring that only approved users have the ability to configure integrations. This layer of security helps in maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information.\nChange Management:\nChange management is a multifaceted process that requires careful planning. Rolling out integrations incrementally, coupled with comprehensive training and support, can facilitate a smoother transition.\nA study by McKinsey found that 70% of transformations\nfail due to lack of uptake, emphasizing the need for developer buy-in and alignment with new workflows.\nStart Small:\nThe allure of connecting all tools at once can be tempting but may lead to complexity and confusion. It's wise to evaluate a minimal set of high-value integrations, pilot them with a dedicated team, and then expand based on the insights gained. By focusing on solving critical problems first, organizations can ensure a more targeted and effective implementation.\n‍\nUnlocking the Power of GitHub Integrations\nGitHub has become the epicenter of software collaboration and integration.\nWhile integrations provide immense benefits, they require planning and governance to maximize impact. Start small by connecting GitHub to tools that solve immediate pain points in your workflows. Expand thoughtfully over time as your needs evolve. Approach integrations as a platform for connecting people and processes, not just technologies. Focus on change management and adoption as much as technical implementation.\nIntegrations present an opportunity to unify software development efforts across your business like never before. But lasting results require integrations that enhance, not hinder, developer productivity and team collaboration. With the right strategy grounded in solving high-priority problems, GitHub integrations can help propel your business to new levels of efficiency, visibility, and innovation.\nready to build your future?\nLet's Talk!\nRead More From InfoMagnus.\nCase Study\nInfoMagnus helps Captis Intelligence master cloud migration with AWS\nInsights\n8 ways to collaborate like a pro on GitHub\nInsights\nNeed to get your team trained in GitHub? 6 requirements you should look for.\nInsights\nGitHub migrations: Learn the process, benefits, and strategies for a seamless transition to boost productivity.\nCase Study\nInfoMagnus helps Captis Intelligence master cloud migration with AWS\nInsights\n8 ways to collaborate like a pro on GitHub\nInsights\nNeed to get your team trained in GitHub? 6 requirements you should look for.\nInsights\nGitHub migrations: Learn the process, benefits, and strategies for a seamless transition to boost productivity.\nWe love knowledge-sharing.

This strategic move catapults Captis into a new realm of operational agility, performance, and scalability, addressing the burgeoning demands of a global user base that has now crossed 20 million.\nThe Inflection Point: Addressing Business and Technological Challenges\nLaw enforcement agencies have been grappling with limited resources and a mounting backlog of unsolved crimes. Captis Intelligence's Solveacrime.com (SAC) platform aimed to bridge this yawning gap but encountered constraints in their existing IT infrastructure.\nThe AWS migration has been more than a technological pivot; it marks a paradigm shift aimed at optimizing both user engagement and operational efficiencies.\nThe Guts of the Migration: A Multi-layered Transformation\nDario Brebric, President of Captis Intelligence, notes that this wasn't \"a mere transfer of assets\" but rather a \"full-scale digital transformation.\" AWS's vast, interconnected service landscape has become the linchpin for Solve A Crime's enhanced capabilities, from DNS transformation and content delivery to application and data migration.\nDNS Transformation:\nThe transition from GoDaddy to AWS Route 53 wasn’t merely a change of venue but a strategic move to exploit Route 53’s robust routing capabilities.\nContent Delivery Overhaul:\nSwitching from Cloudflare to AWS CloudFront has drastically improved content distribution, integrating seamlessly with AWS's other state-of-the-art services.\nApplication and Data Migration:\nThe core API servers and storage systems have been migrated to AWS EC2 and S3, simplifying the platform’s architecture and management operations.\nSpecialized Services:\nText indexing and face recognition technologies, once run on legacy systems, are now powered by AWS Elasticsearch and AWS Rekognition, respectively.\nThe Aftermath: A Paradigm Shift in Community-Driven Crime Solving\n\"The team at InfoMagnus delivered the right technologies and support for our industry-first, Solveacrime.com product, allowing us to achieve the desired timeframe and take the product to market,\" said Dario Brebric, President of Captis Intelligence.\nSince the AWS migration, SAC has realized reductions in operational complexities, latency, and costs. With a now-optimized set of tools, Captis Intelligence can focus on what they do best: enhancing public safety and reducing crime.\nAbout Captis Intelligence\nCaptis Intelligence disrupts the criminal investigation landscape with its Solve A Crime platform, now backed by an agile, scalable AWS architecture.\nAbout InfoMagnus\nInfoMagnus provides world-class IT solutions, offering unparalleled support in digital transformations like the one undertaken by Captis Intelligence.\nshare the future\nwant to learn more about how InfoMagnus is changing the technology landscape? reach out!\nLet's Talk!\nCareers\nPerspectives\nWhat We Believe\nLocation\nWhat We Do\nCustomer Engagement\nAdvanced CE\nGitHub\nGitHub Consulting / Training Workshops\nAWS\nStartups\nData and Analytics\nData Modernization\nApp Modernization\nCloud Acceleration\nCloud Migration\nCustom Software\nHow We Work\nDevOps\nMethodology & Strategy\nTechnology\nconnect with us\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms & Conditions\nCookies Policy\nPrefer To Talk?

liftoff
we help startups succeed with our MVP in-a-box package
You are a start-up company with the desire to turn your innovative ideas into products but need help to build a software solution.
Often, startups waste their funding by hiring inexperienced developers and, on average, switch 4 times before achieving their product goals.
With our “MVP In-A-Box” package, we offer startup companies the ability to deliver a real product, not a tappable prototype, for a set price between $60,000 - $75,000.
we bring the entire software development lifecycle to your organization
At InfoMagnus, we have spent the last 8 years helping over a dozen startup companies reach their goals by deploying an effective, cost-conscious hybrid model of technologists based in the United States and support from our own team in India, to ensure your MVP release falls within budget.

This includes helping develop your team as it learns new technologies and approaches to IT excellence. We intend to achieve success with you, not for you.
Customer Focused Design
Engaging with you and your customers enables us to more easily turn up opportunities for increased value in interface design, process implementation and user expectations.
Measured User Efficiency
We measure the time it takes our people to complete tasks allowing us to create a baseline that sets new system performance expectations in terms of user efficiency.
Persona Driven Prioritization
We build a set of personas that describe the categories of users that interact with the system. This measurement is used as a baseline to set new system performance expectations in terms of user efficiency.
Point Based Estimation
We estimate features using a method called points-based estimation to quickly size items and easily determine what features will cost more than others.
Software Walkthroughs
We rhythmically engage with the business to solicit feedback on the current software version. This drives better clarity, regular feedback, and gives us the ability to constantly course correct.
Analysis Engagement
We actively test the software on a weekly basis to determine progress against business objectives. Our analysts serve as a guidance system for the program throughout the construction life-cycle.

Timeline
Since 2017
Winning In The E-Commerce Space Means Having A Solid Data Strategy.
“Whatever the present circumstance, there is always a better solution.”
That was the guiding principle of Sonny King, Founder of Advantage Solutions more than 30 years ago.
Today, Advantage is an industry leader offering customizable and technology-enabled sales and marketing solutions using real-time data driven insights to empower brands and retailers to grow sales, lower costs and solve problems.
Advantage’s unique perspective to identify needs, pain points and areas of opportunity has been a benchmark of the company’s strategy and has allowed it to proactively invest in advanced technologies, seize opportunities and acquire analogous businesses along the way.
But outside the walls of their traditional brick and mortar clients was an emerging sector – a fast growing niche of companies dedicated to helping independent and large-scale retailers and manufacturers navigate the often unforgiving and ever evolving ecosystem of managing online marketplaces like Amazon.
So, in 2014, Advantage began making several strategic acquisitions to enrich their digital commerce line of business, with a primary focus on companies that delivered a deep knowledge of client-side online marketplace optimization. In short, these companies are experts in tailoring brand-first driven strategies that help retailers and manufacturers navigate several critical factors within marketplace ecosystems, including: brand management; listing optimization; price monitoring; advertising; data-mining research; logistics, and customer review management.
These marketplaces are not one size fits all. To have a winning e-commerce business, you need access to actionable, real-time data. Without it, businesses fly blind, guessing what might work, while wasting valuable time and resources on strategies that do not deliver results. Having rich, actionable data allows businesses to fine-tune their operations for maximum efficiency and profitability.
For Advantage to scale and build upon existing systems with their newly acquired acquisitions, they needed a technology partner with the experience to deliver a data strategy and build a unified data warehouse and create a data-driven culture with up-to-the-minute analytics, giving leaders a clear view of operations while improving efficiencies and effectiveness across a myriad of disparate sources.
What We Did
Developed a powerful SaaS-built data warehouse on Azure with Snowflake
Implementation on Azure Services, including: API Management, Blob Storage and .NET
Constructed an ETL to deliver fully managed, serverless hybrid data integration with Azure Data Factory
Implemented an array of AWS services, including: CloudWatch, IAM, SQS, Seller Central APIs and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
Data visualization via Microsoft Power BI and Microsoft Power Automate to streamline repetitive tasks and paperless processes
The business challenge: From flying blind to actionable insights in real-time.
Data is the lifeblood of e-commerce. It not only helps businesses understand who their customers are, what they want, and how to market to them, it is also critical in determining how sellers approach their overall strategy within the marketplace itself.
Manufacturers and retailers must navigate a myriad of omni-channel layers that all require tremendous insights to stay ahead of the curve and remain competitive. And because e-commerce data exists almost entirely in a virtual space, it generates complex and comprehensive datasets that must be aligned to business processes to provide anything meaningful.
The challenges Advantage faced was twofold: management needed access to data in a timely manner along with an analytics solution that would allow leaders in key departments to make decisions faster and with more accuracy.
Without this, Advantage’s Digital Commerce unit was essentially flying blind. Lacking any IT infrastructure, leadership was forced to rely on several different island systems all pulling from disparate sources leading to fragmented, conflicting, and poor data quality.
And, without any automation in place, manual intervention was required. Departments were tasked with combining, unifying, and massaging this information into excel spreadsheets and using basic third-party software tools to generate reports. Without a unified system, management was left to make decisions based on data that was weeks, and in some instances, months old.
This severely hindered any attempts to parse, measure and analyze any key performance indicators (KPIs) within a product’s category, while reducing the visibility on how well a product was selling, the inability to align purchasing orders from vendors with sales systems, and uncertainty with warehouse management systems for shipping and delivery.
From The Client
Our operational challenges have been extremely difficult to manage and [they] have demonstrated a high level of technical expertise, integrity, professionalism and teamwork.
– Kendrick Oates, Product Manager at Advantage Solutions
‍
Winning In The E-Commerce Space.
In 2021, e-commerce sales amounted to approximately $4.9 trillion worldwide, according to Statista – a leading provider of market and consumer data. That figure is forecast to grow by 50 percent over the next four years, reaching nearly $7.4 trillion by 2025.
The complex e-commerce ecosystem is fraught with monthly, weekly, daily, and even hourly changes that include factors like pricing strategies, customer segmentation, search optimization and rankings, and product reviews.
Winning on marketplaces like Amazon and its 5-million-plus sellers requires tremendous dedication lead by actionable insights. And in order to understand the ins and outs, companies must be laser focused on every aspect of the buyers journey to deliver a seamless experience, while improving operational effectiveness and efficiency along the way.
After analyzing the business processes during a month-long discovery phase, InfoMagnus analysts and technology consultants concluded that Advantage needed a holistic, comprehensive, end-to-end solution – one that would allow team leaders to get access to near real-time data allowing key stakeholders to respond quickly to market factors and adjust the course of action if needed – ultimately transforming Advantage into a data driven business.
To meet the requirements, InfoMagnus designed and implemented a data warehouse that integrated several outside sources from the most important operational systems by bringing everything into a centralized location daily. The data is modeled in a way that is aligned with Advantage’s reporting and analytics needs via several dashboards and analytics solutions for different domains of the business, including: sales and brand management, inventory management, sales summary dashboards, and advertising trend analysis.
‍
Accelerated Growth With Data And Analytics.
As a trusted technology partner, InfoMagnus was able to deliver a centralized data warehouse and analytics solution on-time and on budget using several advanced technologies that will allow Advantage’s digital commerce units to absorb large amounts of information, while providing high level visibility within several category metrics.
From a solution standpoint, InfoMagnus developed a completely new SaaS-based data warehouse using Snowflake hosted on Azure cloud to facilitate secure data storage, enable real-time analytics and enterprise-wide data sharing. This combination of cloud-based computing allows Advantage team members to view diverse data sets in a single, native system.
In an effort to accelerate growth InfoMagnus technologist architected unified API management capabilities to streamline workflows across hybrid and multicloud environments, while giving Advantage teams the ability to automate repetitive tasks and boost efficiency all within a customized dashboard.
Thinking ahead, the data platform is designed to be expandable allowing for scale, utilizing timely data driven insights with the ability – in the future – to build intelligence and AI capabilities to not only look at the historical, but to predict what is going to happen in the future with recommended actions.
‍
Becoming A Data Driven Business.
Without the right tools in place, it's difficult for businesses to make data-driven decisions.
Advantage's transformation into a data-driven business has allowed the company to overcome the challenges it faced with management's access to timely data and accurate analytics. The implementation of a data warehouse by InfoMagnus has given Advantage the ability to respond quickly to market factors and make adjustments as needed creating a more efficient and effective operation overall.

Timeline
Since 2022
Powering the compliant cannabis market through visualization.
For Weedmaps, becoming the industry leader in all things cannabis wasn’t easy. Since its inception in 2008, the company has been on the front lines building technology that offers visibility to a variety of cannabis businesses through its SaaS-based product suit to deliver safe, legal and convenient access to consumers worldwide.
Like all e-commerce businesses, Weedmaps relies heavily on aligning its data science efforts with data analysts to build upon and develop a clear picture for several different domains that support its mission to power a transparent and inclusive global cannabis economy.
To help ramp up its capabilities and drive profitable and sustainable revenue through client engagement, Weedmaps named InfoMagnus to their Advanced Analytical team and Business Intelligence group to support in the development of custom data sets, data modeling, domain driven data analysis and custom dashboards powered by Tableau. Team members also assist in quality assurance to deliver on data quality efforts and feature release.
What We Did
Working with the advanced analytical team at Weedmaps, InfoMagnus assists the Business Intelligence Group in developing data assets, Tableau dashboards and critical insights to business leaders.
InfoMagnus assists the Quality Assurance (QA) team by delivering data quality efforts, including clickstream management and feature release support.
Building the future through AI Data Models, InfoMagnus delivered a number of machine-learning algorithms that support: Product Classification; Recency, Frequency and Monetary (RFM) value of customers, and Customer Lifetime Value calculations.
Engineering Growth While Delivering Business Critical Insights.
The popularity of Weedmaps has grown significantly since its humble beginnings. From 24 users in the first couple of months to an average of 1,500 visitors at the end of 2008, Weedmaps has
skyrocketed
to more than 12.1 million visitors per month with the average user spending more than 4 minutes on the site and averaging 4.13 pages per visit.
"The insights from
Weedmaps’ Cannabis in America report
validate what we see every day: The stigma around cannabis is fading as it becomes more embedded in our culture and daily lives,” said Chris Beals, CEO of WM Technology. “This report highlights attitudes and trends within the industry by providing data and information directly from consumers — an important step as we work towards the goal of building a transparent and inclusive cannabis economy.”
To harness and utilize the tsunami of data funneling in from the website and its Android and iOS applications, Weedmaps enlisted InfoMagnus data analysis's to deliver an API integration via Twilio Segment to better understand how users are interacting on the platform.
With insights that aim to unify customer touch points across platforms and channels, Weedmaps can act on website and app events that dive deep into individual user personas, while segmenting audiences to deliver messaging capabilities that reach the right customers at the right time.
To help increase the performance speed of data analysis queries, everything from website engagement data, to paid advertising, social interaction and email are collected from Segment and brought into Amazon Redshift where several different schemas are used to deliver extremely detailed user insights and behaviors. From there, InfoMagnus builds customized dashboards for product and marketing teams as well as leadership and investors to determine the current and future performance of its products and services.
‍
Building The Future With AI-Driven Data Models.
As an online marketplace with thousands of products from hundreds of vendors, WeedMaps required a solution that would help them make sense of large and complex data sets, identify patterns and trends, help automate processes, while improving customer service and creating a more personalized experience.
In order to transform and modernize their current capabilities, InfoMagnus engineered three specific AI-driven, machine learning models that include: product classification; recency, frequency and monetary (RFM) values, and calculations for customer lifetime value.
‍
Product Classification
: With thousands of products covering a myriad of categories, Weedmaps needed a solution that would allow them to help support their curation team and reduce the tedious and manual efforts associated with product nuance. InfoMagnus developed a product classification algorithm, which uses an advanced deep-learning model to encode thousands of product names within their catalog. The new algorithm allows the curation team to process and deliver an extremely accurate cadence within product-like differentiation and can also be used to create custom recommendation engines.
RFM Modeling
: The ability to understand and score high and low value customers is an important way for companies like Weedmaps to gather a holistic view of their audience.
The recency, frequency, and monetary value (RFM) model InfoMagnus developed can be used to segment customers based on their purchase behavior. This model looks at three factors: recency (how recently a customer has made a purchase), frequency (how often a customer makes a purchase), and monetary value (how much money a customer spends per purchase). By segmenting customers based on these factors, Weedmaps can better target their marketing and sales efforts. Additionally, the RFM model can also be used to predict customer churn and identify what customers are most likely to defect to a competitor.
Customer Lifetime Value
: InfoMagnus also developed a customer lifetime value calculation that allows Weedmaps to determine the estimated revenue they can generate from a customer over the course of their relationship. The forecast delivers a 30, 60, and 90-day probability of an individual's loyalty to the Weedmaps brand. This calculation uses the lifetime library of Python developed by MIT and takes into account factors such as customer acquisition costs, retention rates, and average purchase values. Additionally, this calculation can also be used to help companies make decisions about marketing and pricing strategies with a 95% or higher accuracy rate.
From The Client
The stigma around cannabis is fading as it becomes more embedded in our culture and daily lives.
– Chris Beals, CEO of WM Technology
‍
Delivering High-Level Insights To Business Teams And Investors.
With revenues exceeding $193M in 2021, Weedmaps remains the largest e-commerce platform in the cannabis industry. But with competition around every corner, the company remains steadfast in its pursuit to continue building upon its technology and leveraging data to drive outcomes.
“… Weedmaps [is] beginning to make its unparalleled levels of cannabis industry data available to policy makers, cannabis business holders and industry investors to help them make more informed and accurate decisions,” said Beals.
Whether it is problem solving or visibility into several of the company’s domains, including products, storefronts, and delivery, leaders and advisors need access to metrics that provide daily, monthly and yearly KPIs and other operational data specific to each area of the business.
Known as “strategic pillars,” at Weedmaps, these areas of focus deliver insights to executives in the C-suite and investment arms, which allow them to make educated decisions and determinations for the clients it serves, the consumers it provides for and the many divisions within the company itself.
To allow teams, leadership, and advisors a complete 360-degree view of its business operations, InfoMagnus technologists work closely with management to analyze and assess several areas that are critical in delivering internal and global solutions. With visual insights powered by Tableau, InfoMagnus developed several customizable dashboards that give leadership the ability to consume and understand information easily, with the ability to break data down into different dimensions and attributes.
Armed with these insights, leadership can make better decisions and help develop better relationships with its retailers, expand offerings, increase revenue and increase its footprint throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, and beyond.

Timeline
Since June 2016
Delivering a frontline solution in criminal disruption and subject identification with AWS.
In 2016,
Captis Intelligence
teamed with InfoMagnus to launch the world’s first subject intelligence system called Solve A Crime ­­– a worldwide crime solving community with more than 20 million registered users and 30,000 locations nationwide according to the Captis website.
Together with InfoMagnus, that single offering has grown to multiple industry-first interconnected products. The Captis I-4 system, which stands for:
Intelligence, Information, Investigation, Identification
, not only answers the complex demands on security professionals, it creates the ability to operate on the offensive; a comprehensive cloud-based platform that provides intelligence on a pre- and post-crime incident basis to identify and deter criminal activity resulting in significant crime reduction and prevention.
The advancement of the I-4 solution utilizes a number of AWS services, tools and functionalities that provide more than security: the technology delivers optimized asset protection processes; significantly reduces costs; elevates strain on local law enforcement agencies, and proactively manages risk for clients and local communities.
What We Did
Implementation of a content deliver network (CDN) via Amazon Cloudfront
Distribution of incoming application traffic across multiple targets using Elastic Load Balancer
Provided secure, resizable compute capacity to the cloud via Amazon EC2
Delivered object storage services via Amazon S3
Implemented Amazon Rekognition and AWS Fargate for detection and machine learning video analysis
The business challenge:
Build a highly engaged community of individuals to assist in deterring and solving crime.
Today's law enforcement agencies face a number of obstacles in their efforts to help deter criminal activity and solve crimes throughout the nation: underfunded and understaffed agencies simply cannot provide the resources needed to maintain the high volumes of incidents within a geographic area.
Despite significant technological advances, more than 60% of the crimes committed in the United States go unsolved. That national statistic has not improved in over a decade. The rapid expansion of surveillance systems has played a key role in providing evidence of specific crime incidents to law enforcement, but the chances of identifying the suspect remain low: scaled-back law enforcement agencies across the country are expected to conduct costly and labor-intensive investigations on a rapidly increasing flow of crime incidents captured on private surveillance systems.
Captis Intelligence’s Solveacrime.com (SAC) platform supports a database of more than 500GB, housing some 73 million persons of interest (POI); 53 million crime feed records and 2,600 active crimes waiting to be solved.
‍
Navigating Change with the Captis SAC Platform: Preparing for Future Growth.
Built for large amounts of immediate “minute-interactions”, Solveacrime.com’s patented technology utilizes advanced analytics and algorithms and over a dozen forms of digital communication to harness the power of meaningful community engagement. The vast Captis Community is comprised of 10’s of millions of participants, multiple social media conduits, community watch organizations, micro-influencers, virtual communities, and localized digital media. Through its amplification by social reaction, the network of viewers multiplies.
Captis Intelligence partnered with InfoMagnus to develop the SAC platform from the ground up. The initial scope of the project included the implementation of nine public resources using create, read, update, delete (CRUD) endpoints, which included users on the platform, organizations, incidents within a geographic area and POIs.
Throughout development of the Captis SAC platform, the InfoMagnus team was able to pivot and respond swiftly to changes within the initial scope of the project: Whether it was adding additional entities; writing advanced business logic to support database requirements; capturing all research and development activities, and internal support operations for the webbapp, admin, app, api servers and batch servers. In order to plan and scale for the future and meet demands, InfoMagnus relied on Amazon Rekognition and AWS Fargate for detection and machine learning video analysis.
From The Client
"The team at InfoMagnus delivered the right technologies and support for our industry-first, Solveacrime.com product, allowing us to achieve the desired timeframe and take the product to market."
– Dario Brebric, President of Captis Intelligence
‍
Exceeding Expectations with InfoMagnus: Delivering Projects on Time and Within Budget.
As a trusted technology partner, InfoMagnus was able to exceed expectations by delivering an execution branch and following the clients requirements to exacting specifications. Any time there was a deviation, such as time constraints, it was managed and delivered on time and within budget.
One example included the high-visibility Milestone integration, which included the implementation of a sophisticated customer user experience to drive a more rapid and user-friendly on-boarding experience.
InfoMagnus technologists were also able to meet expectations for Captis Intelligence and reduce costs by cleaning irrelevant data in the database of corrupt and inaccurate records, while resolving performance issues using a number of strategic hands-on workarounds, including a ramp-up of the technology stack via Spring-Everything.
‍
Adapting to Change and Scaling Up: Growing a Research and Design Team for Future Needs.
Captis Intelligence's solveacrime.com platform has expanded from an initial engagement of three months to more than five years. The team delivered value by addressing changes quickly and professionally, while growing our research and design organization to 10 developers to support incoming requests.
In more than 70% of cases, SAC has resulted in a significant reduction in future criminal incidents occurring at a given location. Captis solveacrime.com has been successful in identifying, locating and assisting in the apprehension of criminals as well as in the generation of publicity about crimes being committed and solved, resulting in a significant reduction in theft incidents at businesses using the site. Today, the Captis SAC platform has more than 2,344 active crime listings, by which the public has contributed and solved some 143 crimes.

Timeline
Since August 2016
GeoStamp is a software solution designed with drayage in mind.
GeoStamp is a software that optimizes the efficiency of trucking fleets at terminals to increase the total number of moves transacted. This is achieved by providing a variety of views, allowing an operations team to identify bottlenecks and to uncover areas for improvement.
GeoStamp offers the user analytical insights that allows for historical views or real-time perspective. GeoStamp easily integrates into GPS providers, dispatch systems and financial systems.
The custom software developed by InfoMagnus currently measures turn times for more than 9,000 trucks in over 500 facilities and is used by trucking companies, container shipping companies, by marine terminal operators and rail yard operators. Seven trucking associations and eight government entities trust GeoStamp to deliver accurate and real-time data.
What We Did
Implementation of Microsoft .NET Framework
Implementation of Microsoft Azure

The business challenge:
To improve the efficacy of shipping port terminal operations.
Before InfoMagnus stepped in to build technology that would assist in measuring turn time–the amount of time it takes a cargo truck to enter the port terminal, load or unload its cargo, and exit the port terminal–the process was a complex and often a manual effort.
The industry needed an automated and more reliable way to capture turn time. A lack of reliable, real-time measurement led to traffic congestion in the port and long wait times for trucking companies. This translated into lost opportunity and lost revenue. It also meant that the port terminals had a lack of consistent data by which to measure their own performance.
‍
Making Moves: How GeoStamp Automates Turn Time and Increases Business Efficiency.
With technology powered by InfoMagnus, Transportation Software Solutions (TSS) developed a product called GeoStamp. GeoStamp software automates the collection of turn time and provides accurate data by which to make real-time decisions and measure performance. The product works seamlessly with GPS providers to collect data and deliver clear, accessible analytics. This allows GeoStamp clients to develop greater efficiency in their business and increase the total number of moves transacted.
The software provides a variety of data views, allowing an operations team to identify traffic bottlenecks and uncover areas for improvement.
GeoStamp also offers trucking management system and invoice integration that provides a seamless and transparent syntheses with financial systems. The software operates exclusively in the cloud and requires little to no management.
Individual companies purchase data subscription for approximately $1,500 per month. Larger organizations, such as port authorities, purchase aggregate data for $6,000 per month.
From The Client
"We significantly increased our revenue per truck as a result of GeoStamp developing a SaaS based trucks monitoring system that integrated GPS, dispatch and accounting systems."
– Brian Griley, President and CEO, Southern Counties Express
‍
Turning Up the Efficiency: Using Clear Data to Improve Port Terminal Performance.
The access to clear, real-time, actionable data is improving performance measurement and port terminal efficacy. Marine terminal operators have become more efficient and can compare their performance with other port terminals. They now have a better mechanism to help them pinpoint areas of improvement.
GeoStamp currently measures turn time for approximately 9,000 trucks and over 500 facilities including marine terminals, rail yards, distribution centers, warehouses, customer yards, storage yards and transportation corridors.
It is used by trucking companies, container shipping companies, marine terminal operators, and rail yards.
‍
Reassurance on the Road: How Automation & Seamless Billing Improve Customer Service for Trucking Companies.
Trucking companies have been able to increase revenue. Based on predictions and aggregate reports, they can choose the fastest terminals, therefore increasing the amount of total transactions. They also have a mechanism to accurately bill their client for wait time at the port terminals. Trucking companies can use performance data to negotiate contract pricing.
The data enables them to show customers how their performance compares to other trucking companies.
Automation has improved real-time data accuracy. With dispatch integration, container number, leg type, and other relevant customer information is available that allows for seamless billing and reduced manual processes. The customers of GeoStamp trucking companies no longer have to rely on physical tickets or verbal validation. GeoStamp reports are irrefutable.

the roadmap
we deliver strategies that drive outcomes
No matter where you stand in your cloud journey, our team of architects work with clients to understand workloads, determine migration types, management options, and approaches that deliver a successful move to cloud.
Rehost
We can move your application’s underlying resources from an on-premise data  center to the cloud as-is. The application codebase remains the same, the infrastructure is migrated to cloud infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), including cloud-based storage, compute, and network resources
Refactor
We take the application codebase, which largely remains the same, while it is migrated to cloud infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), including cloud-based storage, compute, and network resources. Developers can reuse investments in languages, frameworks, and containers, thus leveraging the organization’s strategic code.
Rearchitect
The legacy monolithic application is re-architected according to the micro-services model, containerizing them and rolling out modern DevOps practices. This involves decomposing or dividing your monolithic application into a collection of services that can be built, deployed and managed independently.

the roadmap
we deliver strategies that drive outcomes
No matter where you stand in your cloud journey, our team of architects work with clients to understand workloads, determine migration types, management options, and approaches that deliver a successful move to cloud.
Rehost
We can move your application’s underlying resources from an on-premise data  center to the cloud as-is. The application codebase remains the same, the infrastructure is migrated to cloud infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), including cloud-based storage, compute, and network resources
Refactor
We take the application codebase, which largely remains the same, while it is migrated to cloud infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), including cloud-based storage, compute, and network resources. Developers can reuse investments in languages, frameworks, and containers, thus leveraging the organization’s strategic code.
Rearchitect
The legacy monolithic application is re-architected according to the micro-services model, containerizing them and rolling out modern DevOps practices. This involves decomposing or dividing your monolithic application into a collection of services that can be built, deployed and managed independently.

Retail Goods | Sales and Marketing | Business Solutions
Timeline
Since November 2018
Modernizing a data warehouse and advanced analytics solution for more than 200,000 retail locations.
In 2018,
Advantage Solutions
(Advantage) was looking for a technology partner with the capabilities to reimagine and architect a new data warehouse that could accommodate data for more than 2,000 manufacturers' products at 200,000 retail locations and instructions for thousands of retail service team members.
As Advantage began to scale and grow, the organization faced technology hurdles that limited their ability to extract data and manage data integrity.
Like many organizations facing modernization challenges, Advantage was faced with an aging technology stack, hindering any potential to support and scale for its more than 50,000 employees.
InfoMagnus was chosen as Advantage's technology partner to architect an entirely new cloud-driven data warehouse and advanced analytic solution that would support and deliver a dependable future for years to come.
What We Did
Staged and unified multiple data sources originating in SQL Server and PostgreSQL using Talend
Data was loaded into an AWS Aurora instance of PostgreSQL
Designed and created reports, dashboards and advanced analytics using Tableau and Qlik software
Supported Microsoft technologies including: Microsoft Active Directory; Microsoft Internet Information Services: Power BI and SQL Server Integration Services
The business challenge: To enable more efficient and reliable delivery of retail services and data to clients and internal services teams.
Over the course of several years, Advantage had leveraged multiple technologies for each of its business units, while company acquisitions added technology stacks that impeded the move toward modernization. This created a complex technical environment and complicated the access and extraction of data both internally and to service teams in the field.
Data integrity suffered from limitations imposed by structure, history, and multiple technologies, while accurate reporting and data analysis became increasingly difficult.
The data Advantage collects contains critical information that produces instructions so that Advantage service teams can perform their duties and provide consumer insights.
From The Client
Infomagnus has been an exceptional partner in several large initiatives at Advantage. They have demonstrated the ability to architect, build and maintain several enterprise level, custom built applications.
– Bill Crane, Director of Application Development
‍
In Pursuit of Big Data Success: Exploring the Multi-Year Data Warehouse Modernization and Advanced Analytics Project.
Advantage partnered with InfoMagnus to embark on a multi-year data warehouse modernization and advanced analytics project.
The first phase was to build a data warehouse strategy to combine the Retail Services data warehouse and Advantage Retail Technology Services (ARTS) data warehouse into a single solution which serves as the reporting data source for internal teams and Advantage field representatives.
In stride, InfoMagnus technologist began the design and implementation of the data warehouse strategy, which included:
‍
Selection of the appropriate technology,
Architecture of new data warehouse and its implementation,
Application of common data structures & technology,
Configuration & sizing of the development, test and production environments,
Design, documentation, testing, & implementation of the necessary ETL process,
Design, documentation, and implementation of reports and dashboards.
‍
The Success of the Unified Data Warehouse.
The unified data warehouse has been successfully designed and implemented within the agreed time and budget. Technical complexity has been reduced and organizational efficiencies have been achieved.
The system design and technology stack were reviewed by experts from Amazon, Talend and third-party consultants and was recognized as having a “Robust Design” aligned with industry best practices.

Empower Your Teams to Master and Execute Migrations.
We offer comprehensive and seamless migration service, ensuring efficiency, clarity, and client empowerment from start to finish.
MIGRATION
We Help Clients with Seamless Transitions, and End-to-End Migration Solutions.
At InfoMagnus, our migration service emphasizes efficiency and clarity. We own the migration process from inception to completion, encompassing repositories, pipelines, and integrations.
Beyond the migration, we provide clients with robust training and upskilling, ensuring they're well-equipped and confident to take ownership of the solution.
We Deliver Full-Circle Migration Solutions Dedicated to Client Success.
Assessment:
We begin by understanding your specific goals for GitHub adoption.
Our team identifies the essential repositories and pipelines targeted for migration and meticulously crafts a comprehensive delivery plan to set the course.
Validation:
Our validation process is rooted in extensive research and experience.
We validate the instance configuration, conduct dry run migrations, install tooling and scripts, all leading to utilizing standardized processes and scripts, and includes customization of the actual migration of repositories and pipelines.
Migration:
The core phase involves transitioning the identified repositories and pipelines, and re-establishing integrations.
Our approach prioritizes efficiency, utilizing standardized processes and scripts, and include customization when needed.
Notably, we have a strong track record, having successfully migrated over 15,000+ repositories and pipelines combined to GitHub and GH Actions.
Education:
We take pride in empowering our clients and are committed to your success.
We believe that every engagement is an opportunity for GH training to upskill and prepare clients to own the final deliverables – without a solid foundation, the journey is far more difficult.
Based on our assessment, and conversations with clients along the way, we highlight areas where GH training should be leveraged to build that foundation.

Optimizing GitHub Enterprise: A Tailored POC with InfoMagnus.
Enterprise Proof of Concept (POC), offers a structured approach to evaluate GitHub Enterprise, ensuring alignment with your specific operational and strategic goals.
GHE POC
Navigating Your Digital Transformation with Precision and Expertise.
Our GitHub Enterprise Proof of Concept (GHE-POC) service allows organizations to explore and validate the integration of GitHub solutions in their enterprise environments.
This comprehensive assessment ensures a seamless adoption, addressing scalability, security, and collaboration needs effectively.
Crafting Bespoke POC Strategies for Success.
Assessment:
Our journey starts with a comprehensive assessment. Our experts dive into the details of repositories and pipelines, aligning them with your prerequisites for migration to GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC).
Additionally, we assist in configuring the Proof of Concept (POC) instance of GHEC, ensuring that it's tailored to your unique operational needs and provides a realistic environment for thorough evaluation.
Migration Trials:
Rather than diving headfirst, we advocate for a phased approach. By initially migrating a select set of POC repos and pipelines, we can gauge efficiency, addressing any challenges in real-time.
This "test run" with your engineering team in a controlled environment is instrumental in ensuring a seamless transition later.
Evaluation of the POC:
Once the POC instance is set up and configured, and the POC targeted repos and pipelines are ready, that’s where the exploration begins.
Clients can evaluate the platform, explore its features, and understand how it will transform the way they develop and manage code today – and InfoMagnus will be there to help them along the way.
With frequent calls to check in on progress, we are committed to helping the customer see the vision and the value.
Roadmap Development:
Post trial migrations, we take the insights gathered to curate a detailed migration roadmap.
This ensures you have clarity on the subsequent steps, timelines, and expected outcomes.
We can also help build a roadmap that includes education and upskilling and next steps for your adoption of the platform.

Harnessing the Power of Unified Data: Advantage Solutions' Technological Transformation
Since its inception in 1987, Advantage Solutions has been a trailblazer in the realm of brand development, offering manufacturers and retailers a unique blend of sales, marketing, and technology solutions rooted in insightful analysis. Their journey has been marked by an ambitious growth strategy, with over 50 acquisitions since 2014 propelling them to the forefront as the nation's premier provider of in-store sales, merchandising, and marketing services.
Their clientele is a veritable who's who of the retail and consumer-packaged goods (CPGs) industries. From retail giants like Costco, Walmart, Target, and Kroger to renowned CPG brands such as Unilever, Mars Wrigley, Bayer, and SC Johnson, Advantage Solutions has been the go-to partner for those seeking to enhance their brand value.
‍
What We Did
Designed, built, deployed, and configured a unified data warehouse using Snowflake.
Utilized Amazon Web Services (AWS) for hosting the new data warehouse.
Employed the third-party tool, Talend, for data extraction from various source systems.
Leveraged Amazon S3 storage for data security and unlimited storage.
Implemented AWS Direct Connect for rapid data replication from the on-premises database to the AWS-hosted Snowflake.
Navigating the Maze: Advantage Solutions' Journey Towards Technological Consolidation.
Advantage Solutions found itself in a complex labyrinth of overlapping customer bases as a result of its numerous acquisitions. Each business unit, having its own unique technology solution, operated independent data warehouses and analytics tools. The company's approach to providing a unified view of data involved a daily ingestion of information from each data warehouse, followed by a manual transformation into a standardized data set. This data set was then disseminated through enterprise reports via the customer's preferred tool. However, this daily process was not immune to human error and fell short of meeting the customer's growing demand for near real-time insights.
As the company expanded its services to a larger number of Consumer-Packaged Goods (CPGs) across multiple business units, the volume of issues began to surge. Over a span of two years, the percentage of CPGs serviced simultaneously by multiple Advantage Solutions business units ballooned from 28% to over 80%. This growth was accompanied by an inconsistency in delivering the promised enterprise reports to the CPGs.
In an effort to mitigate the risk of service reduction and potential breach of contract lawsuits, Advantage Solutions was faced with the challenge of providing cost-effective and reliable near real-time reports. Their initial attempt to address this issue involved consolidating the business units into a single technology stack. However, after investing $6M in two internal projects that failed to deliver the desired outcome, the company decided to bring in external expertise.
A consulting firm was hired, proposing a three-year, $30M plan to streamline business processes and technology into a unified approach, aptly named "one best way".
‍
Embracing Change: Advantage Solutions' Shift to a Unified Data Warehouse with InfoMagnus.
The $30M plan proposed by the consultants was met with skepticism, prompting IT stakeholders at Advantage Solutions to seek an alternative. They turned to InfoMagnus, who proposed a unified data warehouse as a more cost-effective solution.
The business requirements were clear-cut:
A cost-optimized solution that would maintain or reduce operating expenses.
Near real-time updates of source data reflected in over 120 customer reports.
A system capable of streaming more than 10 million records daily, including files hundreds of GBs in size.
Retirement of the aging on-premises SQL data warehouse, which was responsible for over 70% of data volume.
Compliance with security requirements as stipulated by customer contracts and the Advantage Solutions Security Officer.
InfoMagnus, an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Partner, took on the challenge and designed, built, deployed, and configured a new data warehouse using Snowflake. This new data warehouse, hosted in AWS, replaced multiple on-premises data warehouses, including an enterprise MSSQL database. The retirement of the MSSQL instance, which accounted for 72% of the volume, resulted in an annual savings of $94,000 on licensing.
The architecture of the new solution was as follows:
Data was extracted from various source systems using the third-party tool, Talend.
This data was then pushed from Talend into Amazon S3 storage.
Using the Bulk Copy command, data was moved into the Snowflake data warehouse hosted in AWS.
Amazon S3 was chosen for its unlimited storage, timestamping capabilities, and encryption features to ensure data security. Advantage Solutions experienced improved performance and resiliency with AWS, leading to a decision to increase AWS workloads and decrease Azure consumption. The company utilized AWS Direct Connect to replicate data from the on-premises database to the AWS-hosted Snowflake. This strategy facilitated a swift data migration, shaving off a week from the project timeline.
From The Client
The elimination of manual processes led to an estimated annual time saving of 12,480 hours within the business team.
‍
Reaping the Rewards: The Impact of the Unified Data Warehouse on Advantage Solutions.
The introduction of the Retail Unified data warehouse brought significant value to Advantage Solutions' business intelligence, internal operations, and customer relations. The consolidation into a single data warehouse facilitated automatic data normalization and established a single source of truth. The AWS architecture underpinning the system enabled continuous updates, leading to near real-time reports and an impressive 86% improvement in performance. The business intelligence team saw a reduction in their support hours by 40% in the first year, freeing up time for new development, including the delivery of 20 enterprise customer dashboards.
The business was able to uphold customer trust by delivering comprehensive, near real-time reporting as promised. The elimination of manual processes led to an estimated annual time saving of 12,480 hours within the business team. This newfound time was redirected towards data analysis and the creation of action plans to boost customer Return on Investment (ROI). The ability to access near-real time data also had operational implications. Management gained immediate visibility into completed work, enabling real-time feedback. This led to improved compliance, a 7% increase in overall on-date execution, and a near elimination of non-billable "fix it" store visits.
But perhaps the most significant impact was on Advantage Solutions' customers. They received the promised reports, and for many, near real-time reporting across all chains and regions was a novel experience. This newfound visibility empowered smarter decisions on the use of merchandising services, leading to improved ROI. As reports were consistently delivered and outages reduced by over 80%, customer trust in Advantage Solutions grew.

Timeline
Since September 2016
Measuring the impact of marketing campaigns and the effects on customer satisfaction.
Avalara
–a leading provider of cloud-based tax compliance solutions–was looking for a trusted technology partner to help solve a rather complex business challenge.
Helping over 20,000 businesses achieve compliance with transaction taxes coupled with employees headquartered in Seattle and offices throughout the world, their robust organization was looking to meld its dedication to customer service with the efforts made within its marketing department through data. The goals shared a direct correlation–revenue.
Together with InfoMagnus, Avalara was able to achieve a path forward by taking disparate databases in marketing, sales, finance and IT and unifying them under a new data warehouse using relevant data from both customer satisfaction efforts and marketing campaigns into one platform.
What We Did
Implementation of Microsoft SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services)
Microsoft SQL Server 2012
SQL Server Analysis Services
Excel-based reporting with the use of PowerPivot
Reports and dashboards published through SharePoint
The business challenge:
accurately measure marketing program effectiveness and customer satisfaction.
Avalara partnered with InfoMagnus to help solve a business challenge both internally within the organization and externally with their customers: marketing department’s wanted to measure the effectiveness of sales promotions, website content, and social media impact on sales performance, while adhering to company's culture of customer satisfaction.
At Avalara, entire departments and individual executives are rewarded based on the results of their customer satisfaction scorecard.
Although these challenges were diverse in nature, these two business goals are related through their effect on revenue; more effective marketing programs and higher customer satisfaction produce higher revenue in this software subscription model.
Accomplishing these business challenges proved to be even more difficult as the data was spread out among dozens of disparate databases in Marketing, Sales, Information Technology, and Finance. The data needed to be unified from Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics GP (ERP) and multiple other systems in order to build analytics and reporting on top of it.
‍
Real-Time Data Analysis: How Avalara and InfoMagnus Joined Forces to Create a Centralized Data Warehouse for Extracting, Transforming and Loading Data.
Avalara partnered with InfoMagnus to create a data warehouse where relevant data from all sources was extracted, transformed, and loaded into one platform. Together, we implemented Master Data Management (MDM) to ensure data integrity throughout the supported systems.
InfoMagnus automated all steps of extracting data from disparate sources, transforming, loading, and producing reports using the new data platform. We developed analytical and reporting solutions, both in a relational database as well as a big data environment, to demonstrate effectiveness of marketing and sales campaign.
Also, customer satisfaction dashboards could now be developed at the department and executive level.
From The Client
"The complex data warehouse and analytical system InfoMagnus developed has become our backbone for customer satisfaction and sales trending analytics."
– Kevin Riegelsberger, Chief Strategic Initiatives Officer, Avalara Inc.
‍
Exploring the Potential of Big Data.
With more than 20,000 clients, 6.7 billion transactions processed, $30 billion prepared in taxes, 18 million tax documents managed, and 1,500 employees, the opportunities to capture and analyze customer satisfaction data are exponential and so are the opportunities to measure marketing program effectiveness on over $272 million in sales.
‍
The Impact of Proactive Programs: Examining Avalara's Growth Since Implementing Strategies Five Years Ago.
Although difficult to measure the exact impact, it is important to note that Avalara has grown significantly since these programs were implemented almost 5 years ago.
Revenue grew from approximately $60 million in 2013 to over $272 million in 2018.

Enterprise Risk Management | Strategic Planning | Capital Planning | Compliance
Timeline
Since May 2015
Incorporating the entire FDIC database to measure key metrics.
Recognized by CFO Tech Outlook Magazine as a Top 10 Risk Management and Compliance Company in 2019,
CB-Resources
is a risk management and planning firm located in Irvine, California.
Its primary focus is to help community banks synchronize their business performance and risk management priorities. CBR seamlessly integrates Enterprise Risk Management, Strategic Planning, and Capital Planning solutions.
When CB-Resources needed to update their client experience and ensure their data was well-prepared and clean, they turned to InfoMagnus to develop a SaaS-based solution called CB BankAnalytics™. Today, the solution incorporates more than 20 million bank records, while the system can track and report on over 125 key risk trends.
What We Did
Developed on the Microsoft Azure platform
Automated data retrieval and preparation
Intuitive, user-friendly dashboards delivered via web portal
CB BankAnalytics™ interface is built o the .NET framework
The business challenge:
to help community banks measure their performance and manage risk based upon financial ratios.
For over two decades, CBR has been providing a variety of financial models to community banks. These models allow for comparison of a bank’s financial ratios against the overall banking industry or a segment of the industry that is comparable to the bank itself.
CBR wanted to improve their clients’ experience by updating the user interface and ensuring the data was as fresh as possible.
‍
Unlocking Profitability: How CB BankAnalytics™ is Transforming the Way Banks Access Financial Models.
CBR partnered with InfoMagnus to create a SaaS-based solution called CB BankAnalytics™. It allows individual banks to log into a portal-based solution and access hundreds of financial models.
Individual banks can easily review their own performance, compare against the entire banking industry or one segment, access models that support “what if” analysis when the bank’s assets under management change, and access data that facilitates expansion plans.
CBR’s clients find it indispensable when focusing on growth, profitability, efficiency and value creation. They say it is ideal for strategic or capital planning, risk management, M&A, and regulatory compliance.
From The Client
"Infomagnus stepped in and assumed the role of CTO, CIO and CISO in leading the development of our community bank risk management and analytics platform.”
– Jeff Rigsby, CEO CB Resource
‍
Unlimited Possibilities: Empowering Banks to Make Informed Decisions on Risk Management and Financial Forecasting.
The solution incorporates the entire FDIC database consisting of financial reports provided by all banks in the United States. There are over 20 million bank records in database.
The system can track and report on over 125 key risk trends. It can also create up to 8 five-year “forecast/what if” scenarios per institution.
‍
A Partnership of Innovation: How CBR and InfoMagnus are Leading the Way in Financial Software Solutions.
CB BankAnalytics™
has been in production for three years and is quickly becoming a standard for managing performance and risk by community banks.
The SaaS system transforms the user experience from an Excel-based file solution to a subscription-based platform that is user friendly, current, and collaborative in nature. It now is the primary means of interaction between CBR and its clients.
Today InfoMagnus continues to partner with CBR to develop new functions. InfoMagnus’ offshore development resources provide maintenance and support for the daily needs of CBR clients.

The business challenge: Deliver the capability to order the correct amounts of product based on historical trends – automatically.
This retailer works as a middle layer between the manufacturer of retail products and the retail stores. Generally the stores order small quantities of product on a daily basis.
They make educated guesses as to how much product to put in their delivery trucks and many times they are not carrying the correct amounts. This causes reduced sales by the store and another trip by the partners to deliver the correct product.
This solution takes into account historical trends and provides intelligence on how much product to carry for each store for any given day. Through the use of historical sales, prior deliveries and other variables, the system is able to recommend proper quantities for each store that can typically help retailers see a minimum of 2 percent sales growth.

The Business Challenge: Navigating the Risks of End-of-Life Software.
Prior to the migration, Element Fleet Management faced significant challenges arising from their reliance on end-of-life (EOL) software. The legacy version of their GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) had become unsupported, which exposed the organization to several potential risks.
Notably, the risk of security breaches increased due to a lack of ongoing updates and patches from the software provider, leaving their system susceptible to evolving cyber threats. Additionally, the potential for data loss became a substantial concern, as EOL software often lacks support for modern data protection and recovery solutions. Finally, the specter of system downtime loomed, as the lack of technical support could result in extended outage periods in the event of system issues, with potentially disruptive impacts on operations.
‍
Business Goals: Eliminating Risks and Enhancing Operational Efficiency.
The migration to GHEC opened new opportunities. With access to the latest features and functionalities offered by GHEC, the company could enhance its competitiveness and better support its business objectives. Having mitigated the primary risk to their systems, the team could shift their focus to leveraging these new features and capabilities.
With guidance from InfoMagnus, Element Fleet was able to assess the potential benefits of these features, prioritize their implementation, and develop a robust plan to integrate them into their operations. This strategic approach has positioned the organization to improve the overall performance of their organization and teams, underpinning their ongoing leadership in the global fleet management sector.
The successful migration has also paved the way for the Element team to consider a complete decommission of the old GHES environment. This step would further enhance the security and stability of their system infrastructure, solidifying their commitment to harnessing the best technologies in service of their clients. The strategic partnership with InfoMagnus has played a key role in aligning the organizations IT infrastructure with its ambitious business goals.

‍
Business Outcome: A Successful Migration Paving the Way for Future Innovation.
The strategic partnership between Element Fleet Management and InfoMagnus culminated in a robust technical solution that addressed critical business challenges and aligned with the organizations ambitious goals. This collaboration led to the successful migration of Element Fleet’s repositories from the legacy GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) to the more advanced GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC).
While the primary focus of the project was risk mitigation through migration from the legacy software, Element Fleet eagerly anticipates exploring the additional features associated with their new GHEC environment. However, this exploration is regarded as a benefit of migration rather than the project's primary focus.
In essence, the successful migration from GHES to GHEC not only addressed the immediate challenges faced by Element Fleet, but also set the foundation for future growth and innovation. This collaborative effort has bolstered their position as a leader in its industry, equipped with a robust and modern IT infrastructure that’s built for the future.

The Data Lake Revolution: How Envase Transformed its Data Landscape with AWS.
In the fast-paced, highly competitive landscape of the trucking, ports, and drayage industry, where real-time data is the linchpin of operational efficiency, Envase stands as a leader in mission-critical, cloud-based transportation management system (TMS) enterprise software. Established players and upstarts alike in this sector face the perennial challenge of harnessing dispersed, siloed data—a Gordian knot that constrains strategic decision-making and stifles innovation.
Recognizing the pivotal role that data plays not just in everyday operations, but also in carving out future growth trajectories, Envase embarked on an ambitious journey. The mission? Migrate fragmented data from disparate application databases into a centralized Amazon Web Services (AWS) Data Lake. The objective was clear-cut: create a robust, cross-functional reporting platform that could serve as the nerve center for business intelligence and analytics, while transforming and unlocking new cross-platform capabilities, enabling systems to freely exchange data through web hooks.
By navigating through the complexities of data consolidation, Envase, in partnership with InfoMagus, aimed to achieve something more sublime than mere operational excellence; the project was a steppingstone toward unlocking new horizons in data monetization and prescriptive analysis, ultimately offering a potent competitive edge.
Let’s explore the contours of this transformative project, delving into the technical nuances, business imperatives, and the cascading benefits that have placed Envase at the forefront of data-driven business innovation in its industry.
What We Did
Leveraged AWS Data Lake to centralize and secure diverse data sources across the organization.
Utilized AWS infrastructure as code for scalable, automated, and version-controlled cloud resource management.
Employed AWS-native ETL tools to build robust data pipelines for seamless extraction, transformation, and loading of data.
Integrated AWS with Business Intelligence platforms to enable real-time analytics and reporting capabilities.
Bridging Data Islands: Envase's Quest for a Unified Reporting Platform.
At the nexus of Envase's digital transformation was a deceptively straightforward aim: construct a unified data ecosystem capable of powering cross-platform analytics and reporting. The project, far from being a mere exercise in IT overhaul, was envisioned as a strategic initiative with ramifications that could reverberate across the organizational hierarchy—from ground-level operations to executive decision-making.
Project Description
The plan was ambitious in scope yet pragmatic in execution: migrate a diverse array of data, residing in multiple applications, into a centralized AWS Data Lake. Once consolidated, this data would be streamlined to fuel a state-of-the-art reporting platform. The aspiration was to not only gain insights into operational efficiency and strategic directions but also set the stage for future data monetization initiatives.
Overall Business Value
By breaking down data silos and creating a harmonized data repository, Envase sought to manifest several layers of business value:
Strategic Value: The initiative facilitated broader cross-sectional analytics, arming executives with a 360-degree view of operations and strategic pathways.
Operational Efficiency: With data silos dismantled, departments no longer had to engage in cumbersome data extraction exercises, leading to better resource allocation.
Monetization Prospects: Unifying the data created the groundwork for future monetization strategies, opening new revenue streams that were previously untapped.
Thus, the AWS Data Lake wasn't merely a technical solution; it was a business catalyst, designed to amplify Envase's market competitiveness and long-term viability.
‍
From Bottlenecks to Breakthroughs: The Business Imperative for Envase's Data Lake Initiative.
In an industry where data is the lifeblood of both operations and competitive strategy, Envase found itself confronting a substantial obstacle: its data lived in disparate, siloed repositories, stifling the organization's ability to share information across platforms, let alone analyze it for actionable insights.
Problem Statement
Envase's information architecture was a labyrinthine network of isolated application databases, each holding critical but compartmentalized data. This lack of cohesion was more than a mere inconvenience. It was a debilitating bottleneck that hindered cross-platform sharing, real-time reporting, and sophisticated analysis. Consequently, departments operated in informational vacuums, leading to sub-optimal decision-making, missed opportunities, and operational inefficiencies.
Business Implications
The data fragmentation didn't just pose technical challenges. It had real-world impacts that could be quantified in lost revenue and squandered time. Decision-makers lacked a unified view of operations, affecting strategic planning. Operational teams had to spend significant amounts of time manually extracting and consolidating data for reporting, diminishing productivity. Furthermore, the inability to conduct cross-platform analytics meant Envase was leaving valuable insights—potential game-changers—on the table.
The situation was untenable for a company with ambitions to be an industry leader in data-driven decision-making and operational efficiency. Something had to give, and thus was born the initiative to overhaul this fractured data landscape.
‍
Building the Backbone: The Architecture and Engineering of Envase's AWS Data Lake.
When dealing with intricate data silos that restricted the free flow of information, half-measures wouldn't suffice. Envase understood that a holistic, scalable solution was required to eradicate existing inefficiencies and lay the groundwork for future advancements.
Establishing the AWS Data Lake Environment
The cornerstone of the technical strategy was the AWS Data Lake, a centralized repository designed to ingest, store, and manage data from varied sources in its native format. This move wasn't just about capacity; it was a nod to the scalability, security, and performance that AWS could offer.
Infrastructure as Code and Data Pipelines
To streamline data movement and transformation, InfoMagnus architects implemented 'Infrastructure as Code'—a programming approach that manages infrastructure through code rather than manual processes. This proved instrumental in the creation and refinement of data pipelines. Specifically, the code facilitated:
Extraction:
Pipelines were engineered to pull data from an assortment of application databases, each with its unique schema and storage format. In addition to standardizing data, the pipelines were engineered to support web hooks, enhancing data interoperability across multiple systems.
Transformation: A subsequent layer of pipelines was employed to cleanse, normalize, and standardize this data, prepping it for analytical consumption.
BI Tool Integration
InfoMagnus didn't stop at mere data consolidation. Aware that data is only as good as the insights drawn from it, they established connections to Business Intelligence (BI) tools directly from the AWS Data Lake. This move effectively converted the Data Lake from a passive storage entity to an active analytical hub, making data immediately available for strategic interpretation.
Consultation and Strategy
Key to the project's success was continuous consultation with client stakeholders to assess reporting and analytics requirements. This collaborative approach ensured that the Data Lake's architecture and subsequent pipelines were meticulously aligned with actual business needs, rather than being a tech-driven afterthought.
By marrying cutting-edge technology with a laser-focused understanding of business requirements, Envase was able to create a sophisticated, dynamic data environment, paving the way for cross-functional reporting and analytics.
Milestones and Metrics: Measuring the Success of Envase's Data Lake Project.
In the lexicon of digital transformation, "outcome" isn't merely a buzzword but a concrete measure of efficacy and strategic alignment. For Envase, the AWS Data Lake project yielded a range of outcomes that exceeded mere technical benchmarks, making substantive strides in business performance and operational dexterity.
Evaluation and Data Standardization
The project's scope was not limited to mere data migration, it was augmented by a rigorous evaluation process. Data from 17 unique platforms across over 300 customer platforms or instances were scrutinized. Through this exercise, InfoMagnus was able to establish a standard schema and common data models, turning a once-chaotic data landscape into an organized, searchable trove of information.
Technical Infrastructure and Migrations
The core technical objectives were met with resounding success. The infrastructure, robust and scalable, was delivered as planned, fulfilling all the technical pre-requisites to support the project's multifaceted goals.
Customer Migrations: One of the most crucial outcomes was the migration of 15 customers from a proprietary Truck Management System, a critical milestone that showcased the system's capacity and efficiency.
Rate Tracking:
Data from a system that manages and tracks trucking rates was successfully migrated, providing Envase with a centralized platform for real-time rate analysis.
Future Plans
Envase isn't resting on its laurels. Additional migrations from other applications are slated for the coming months and years. This forward-thinking approach exemplifies the company's commitment to continuous improvement and long-term strategic planning.
The fruits of Envase's labor were not just a series of technical achievements but a collection of business wins—improved efficiency, enhanced analytical capabilities, and a paved road for future growth and data monetization.
‍
Financial Due Diligence: Decoding the Total Cost of Ownership for Envase's Data Lake.
Financial prudence and technical ingenuity often walk hand-in-hand in successful digital transformation projects. For Envase, the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) was not an ancillary concern, but a critical metric that was assessed right from the project's initiation.
Assess Phase and Methodology
The TCO analysis was performed during the Assess phase and incorporated into key project documentation, notably the Assess Phase Closeout and Mobilize Readiness documents. This approach ensured that financial considerations were in lockstep with technical planning, helping to set realistic budgets and manage stakeholder expectations.
Findings and Implications
While the detailed findings are beyond the scope of this case study, the TCO analysis provided pivotal insights:
Cost-Efficiency: The move to an AWS Data Lake was not just technically advantageous but also cost-effective in the long term, especially when considering the manual labor and operational bottlenecks alleviated by data centralization.
ROI Projections: The TCO analysis yielded promising projections for Return on Investment (ROI), particularly when considering the strategic advantages and potential for data monetization that the Data Lake afforded Envase.
Budget Alignment:
The analysis confirmed that the project was in alignment with organizational budget constraints and financial strategies, clearing a crucial hurdle for project approval and execution.
The TCO analysis served as a financial compass for the project, guiding decisions and lending weight to the technical strategies deployed. It corroborated that Envase’s AWS Data Lake initiative was not merely a technologically sound decision but a financially astute one as well.
Beyond the Tech: The Ripple Effects of Envase's Data Lake on Business Strategy and Innovation.
In the final analysis, the success of any technological initiative is gauged not merely by its execution finesse but by its broader ramifications on business health and strategic vision. For Envase, the AWS Data Lake project was not just a solution to a technical problem, it was a pivotal milestone in the company's data-centric business strategy.

Timeline
Since April 2015
Delivering a data solution to improve extraction, reporting and analysis.
For 40 years,
Epic
has worked at the intersection of health care and information technology to connect people and systems around the world.
They use the latest technology to create solutions that let communities and people engage in their own health. Whether they are supporting the clinical, financial or operational areas of a hospital or health system, Epic’s tools are designed to work for today and think for tomorrow.
Epic supports its clients by surfacing data that enables them to make informed decisions for better management of operations, while arming their clinicians with the information they need to provide smarter care.
With the data solution developed by InfoMagnus, a large healthcare provider was able to access actionable information and help improve performance measurement and the efficiency of laboratory services.
What We Did
iLab platform extracts, transforms, and loads data from Epic into a large Oracle database.
SAP Business Objects Tools are used to simplify and improve data access by creating a metadata structure.
SAP’s Web Intelligence accesses the metadata to create actionable reports.
Delivered object storage services via Amazon S3
Integration with Epic for a single direction data extract.
The business challenge:
To improve the efficiency of laboratory services.
Measuring performance at a granular-level has been a challenge for this client based on the complexities of “slicing and dicing” data from Epic.
‍
Users often have a difficult time gathering the data they need. They must go through multiple, time-consuming cycles of report generation, make manual adjustments, and calculations to ready the data for analysis.
In addition, system performance is degrading based on the continuous increase in the size of the database.
‍
Data-Driven Insights: InfoMagnus’ iLab Platform Extracts, Transforms and Loads Data From Epic Into a Large Oracle Database.
InfoMagnus’ solution improves extraction, reporting, and analysis of the necessary data to measure and improve lab performance. The iLab platform extracts, transforms, and loads data from Epic into a large Oracle database.
SAP Business Objects Tools are used to simplify and improve data access by creating a metadata structure. SAP’s Web Intelligence accesses the metadata to create actionable reports. This solution allows for more detailed data analysis than Discern, the reporting tool provided by Epic.
As the database size increases, the Oracle database will be transitioned to Hadoop for better performance. Tableau and PowerBI are also used for Dashboard applications.
From The Client
InfoMagnus’ solution improves extraction, reporting, and analysis of the necessary data to measure and improve lab performance.
‍
Optimized Efficiency: InfoMagnus’ iLab Platform Helps Hospitals and Labs Achieve Improved Data Processing, Analysis and Reporting
iLab has more than 200 users accessing the reporting platform via a web link at 18 hospitals and 33 labs. The system accounts for thousands of patients and tens of thousands of lab tests.
Major users are the Regional Lab Director, Lab System Managers, and Lab Data personnel. This project includes general Lab, Blood Bank, and Microbiology labs. There are plans to add more by the end of the year.
‍
Unlocking Insights: How InfoMagnus Enabled Access to Actionable Information To Help Improve Performance Measurement and Efficiency.
The access to actionable information is helping to improve performance measurement and the efficiency of laboratory services. Reports that took hours to produce now take mere minutes. Specimen turn-around-time is being more accurately measured and reported.
Performance can now be measured at the lab location, technician, and device level. Measurement allows leaders to leverage areas of excellence and work on areas needing improvement.
This project has also improved the working conditions of lab personnel since broken equipment is found and fixed more rapidly. Since Epic is a leading application in the industry and this data reporting and analysis problem is common, this solution can be implemented for any department running similar health information and EHR technologies.

How GitHub Copilot is Transforming Software Development with AI-Powered Coding Assistance.
share this:
By Juma Aman
Senior DevOps Engineer at InfoMagnus
At InfoMagnus, we've been working hands-on with GitHub Copilot over the past year, and I have to say—it’s like stepping into the future of development.
Having seen its impact firsthand, I’m convinced this tool is more than just a novelty. It’s reshaping how we write code, cutting down the routine and freeing up our team to focus on the more creative and complex challenges we face when developing software solutions for our clients.
If you’re a developer and haven’t explored Copilot yet, you might be missing out on what could be the most transformative tool we’ve seen in years.
What is GitHub Copilot?
For those unfamiliar, Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant that turns natural language prompts into code. It integrates smoothly with popular IDEs like Visual Studio Code and aims to increase productivity by helping you generate code snippets on the fly.
Think of it as having a personal coding assistant who understands your needs–well, most of the time… more on that later–and helps speed up your workflow.
Boost Coding Speed and Efficiency with GitHub Copilot’s AI-Powered Assistance.
Let’s talk about speed! Copilot doesn't just help you write code faster, it helps you think faster. Whether it's generating boilerplate code, completing routine tasks, or suggesting ways to solve a problem, Copilot is like that extra set of hands every developer wishes they had.
Need to write a unit test or crank out some basic scaffolding for a project? Copilot can churn it out in seconds. And no, it’s not just copying Stack Overflow answers—it’s smart, it learns from your project, and it adapts to your coding style.
One of my colleagues summed it up well by saying, “It’s like having a copilot who takes over the easy stuff, so you can focus on steering the ship.” And honestly, I couldn’t agree more.
Enhance Developer Creativity and Problem-Solving with GitHub Copilot’s AI Suggestions.
We’ve all been there… staring at a screen, trying to figure out the best way to implement a feature or fix a bug. Copilot excels at providing suggestions that help get the creative juices flowing. It might not always nail the solution on the first try, but it often gets you 80% of the way there, leaving you to do what developers love most: tweak, refine, and perfect.
This boost in creativity is especially helpful when you’re stuck on something small, like figuring out a function or writing a script. Copilot offers fresh perspectives, helping you think outside the box. It’s like brainstorming with another developer, except this one stays focused and keeps you on track!
Leverage GitHub Copilot as a Learning Tool to Master New Languages and Best Practices.
A surprising benefit of Copilot is its potential as a learning tool.
If you’re venturing into a language or framework you're less familiar with, Copilot acts as a guide. It suggests methods, functions, and patterns that you might not have thought of, all while keeping things aligned with best practices. It’s like having a mentor who quietly nudges you in the right direction while you work.
Plus, it’s a great way to stay up-to-date with coding standards. Since it learns from public repositories and the code you’re working on, Copilot tends to reflect current best practices.
It’s almost like having an ever-evolving textbook that writes itself.
Embrace GitHub Copilot’s Imperfections as It Learns and Grows Smarter with Every Use
Now, let’s be real. Copilot isn’t perfect. Sometimes it makes a suggestion that’s not quite right, or it offers a solution that might work, but isn’t optimal for your specific case.
But here’s the thing. It’s constantly learning. And as more developers use it and feed it data, Copilot will only get smarter and more intuitive.
Sure, it might offer a line of code that makes you scratch your head for a second, but let’s be honest–so does that coworker who swears by regex for everything.
The point is, even when Copilot doesn’t hit the nail on the head, it still sparks ideas and often leads you down the right path faster than you’d get there on your own.
Your Coding Partner for Streamlined Development and Creative Problem-Solving.
At the end of the day, Copilot is more than just a tool–it’s a partner in code. It’s there to help you with the tedious parts of development, freeing you up to focus on the bigger, more interesting challenges. It’s not about replacing developers; it’s about empowering us to do more in less time.
And let’s face it: anything that helps us write fewer boilerplate functions and unit tests is worth celebrating. So, if you haven’t already, give Copilot a try. You might just find that it’s the coding buddy you never knew you needed.

Understanding migrations is the first step in ensuring a smooth transition that preserves the integrity of your codebase and minimizes disruptions to your development process.
Migrations to GitHub entail the transfer of not just code, but also the history, branches, tags, and other metadata associated with a repository. For businesses, this can also include the migration of issues, pull requests, and wiki pages. This is crucial for maintaining continuity and ensuring that the historical context of the development process is not lost.
Additionally, migrations often involve the integration of third-party services and tools, which requires careful planning and execution.
Understanding migrations also involves recognizing the potential challenges and risks involved. These can range from technical issues such as data loss or corruption, to more human-centric challenges like adapting to new workflows and tools.
For businesses, mitigating these risks through thorough planning, testing, and communication is essential. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive overview of GitHub migrations for businesses, offering insights and best practices to facilitate a successful transition.
‍
What Types of Migrations are Specific to GitHub?
A migration is typically undertaken when an organization decides to move their software development workflows to GitHub, either from another
version control system
or from a self-hosted system. The goal is to improve collaboration, streamline workflows, and take advantage of the features and integrations offered by GitHub.
Some of the typical migrations include:
Code Repository Migration:
This involves moving a codebase, its history, and related data from one version control system to another, such as from Bitbucket or GitLab to GitHub. This can also include the migration of issues, pull requests, and wiki pages, preserving the historical context and continuity of the development process.
Database Migration:
In the context of GitHub, this could involve moving databases that are associated with the applications being version-controlled on GitHub. This may be necessary if the database schemas or data need to be version-controlled along with the application code.
Cloud Migration:
This involves moving from a self-hosted version control system to a cloud-based system like GitHub. This comes into play if an organization wants to reduce the overhead of maintaining their own version control servers and take advantage of the scalability and collaboration features offered by GitHub.
‍
The Benefits of Migrations: How Migrations can increase productivity, ROI and more.
Migrations to GitHub can offer significant benefits, they should be approached with careful planning and consideration.

Best Practices for GitHub Collaboration.
To ensure a seamless and productive collaborative workflow on GitHub, adopting best practices is paramount. In this section, we explore fundamental guidelines that lay the groundwork for efficient collaboration. From maintaining clear project organization to utilizing pull requests effectively, these practices foster a collaborative environment that propels development teams towards success.
‍
Clear Project Organization and Structure:
The foundation of effective collaboration begins with clear project organization and structure. When initiating a new repository on GitHub, pay special attention to naming conventions, ensuring they are descriptive and intuitive. A well-crafted repository name provides an instant understanding of its purpose and contents, facilitating seamless collaboration for team members and contributors alike.
Moreover, a thoughtfully written README file serves as the gateway to your project. Take advantage of this space to provide comprehensive documentation, outlining the project's goals, functionalities, installation instructions, and any other relevant details. A well-maintained README file not only fosters collaboration within your team but also welcomes external developers and community contributors to engage with your project.
Utilizing Pull Requests (PRs) Effectively:
When it comes to GitHub collaboration, pull requests (PRs) are the backbone of constructive teamwork. Rather than directly merging code into the main branch, submitting a PR allows for systematic code review and collaboration. Developers can propose changes, seek feedback, and engage in discussions before the changes become a permanent part of the codebase.
To maximize the efficiency of PRs, encourage contributors to craft clear, concise, and well-documented pull requests. Include a brief summary of the changes, the problem they aim to solve, and any related issues or milestones. By providing context, reviewers gain a deeper understanding of the proposed changes, leading to more insightful feedback.
Remember, code reviews play a pivotal role in maintaining code quality. Foster a culture where team members embrace feedback and actively participate in the review process. A collaborative code review process can identify bugs, architectural flaws, and potential optimizations, ultimately enhancing the overall robustness of the project.
Continuous Integration and Automated Testing:
Timely and reliable testing is non-negotiable. GitHub allows teams to integrate their repositories with Continuous Integration (CI) tools seamlessly. By automating the testing process, developers can receive rapid feedback on code changes, catching potential issues early in the development cycle.
When configuring CI, create an extensive suite of automated tests that cover critical functionalities and edge cases. These tests act as a safety net, safeguarding the project's stability and functionality. Additionally, CI can automate the build process, ensuring that each pull request is thoroughly tested before merging into the main branch.
By embracing Continuous Integration and automated testing, teams can instill a culture of confidence in their codebase. This culture, in turn, accelerates the development process, encourages experimentation, and fosters innovation.
‍
Tips and Tricks for Streamlined Collaboration.
Unlocking the full potential of GitHub collaboration goes beyond the basics. From enhancing communication with team members to maximizing the use of GitHub Issues and project boards, these strategies streamline the collaborative process, fostering a cohesive and agile development ecosystem.
Mentioning Team Members and Collaborators:
Effective communication lies at the core of successful collaboration on GitHub. When seeking input or feedback from specific team members or collaborators, utilize the "@" mention feature. By mentioning individuals directly in an issue or pull request comment, you ensure that they receive a notification, prompting timely responses and reducing the risk of overlooked discussions.
To keep conversations organized and focused, consider creating separate threads for different topics within an issue or pull request. This way, discussions can flow efficiently, enabling team members to address specific points without confusion.
Maximizing GitHub Issues:
GitHub Issues serve as an indispensable tool for project management, bug tracking, and feature requests. To optimize their use, encourage your team to provide detailed descriptions when creating issues. Clearly define the problem, expected behavior, and steps to reproduce potential bugs.
Labels and milestones are powerful tools for organizing issues and prioritizing tasks. Establish a clear labeling system to categorize issues by type, severity, or status. Similarly, set milestones to track progress and group related issues under specific development phases or releases.
Leveraging Project Boards:
GitHub's project boards offer a visual and intuitive way to manage tasks and workflows. Create custom project boards tailored to your team's specific needs. For example, you might have boards for different development stages like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed."
Encourage team members to update the status of their tasks on the project board regularly. This ensures everyone is aligned on project progress, and potential bottlenecks or roadblocks can be identified early.
Third-Party Integrations:
Extend GitHub's capabilities further by integrating with third-party tools that complement your collaborative workflow. For instance, tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams can be integrated with GitHub, providing real-time notifications and facilitating seamless communication among team members.
Additionally, consider integrating tools for code analysis, security scanning, and documentation generation. These integrations enhance code quality and streamline various development processes, contributing to a more productive collaborative environment.
By leveraging these tips and tricks, teams can unlock the full potential of GitHub collaboration, creating a dynamic and efficient ecosystem where creativity and productivity thrive.
‍

Optimizing Cloud Migration: An Introduction to AWS MAP and the InfoMagnus Partnership with Pacific Dental Services.
AWS understands that the initial step most organizations take toward cloud adoption involves migrating away from their existing data centers. To facilitate a smooth and successful migration, the AWS Migration Acceleration Program (MAP) offers a host of advantageous features to its customers, including:
A prescriptive, step-by-step guide tailored for migrating workloads to AWS.
Specialized AWS services engineered specifically to facilitate smooth migrations.
Financial support from AWS, earmarked for qualified AWS partners to assist customers throughout the critical migration phases of Assessment, Mobilization, and Migration itself.
Pacific Dental Services (PDS) chose to collaborate with InfoMagnus, an AWS Advanced Tier Partner, to leverage their expertise during the AWS MAP Assessment phase. PDS elected to undertake an AWS MAP assessment as they recognized the crucial role AWS could play in hosting their complex technical stack. They understood that to navigate the intricate migration landscape successfully, the guidance of the MAP program, and a qualified partner like InfoMagnus, was essential.
Another incentive was the lower barrier to entry; the program allowed busy IT professionals at PDS to delegate migration assessment activities to AWS Partner InfoMagnus, thus freeing internal resources for other strategic initiatives.
‍
Guiding Success: AWS MAP's Comprehensive Approach to Workload Migrations, Backed by Proven Strategies and Financial Support.
AWS MAP is a prescriptive guide for workload migrations to AWS. This guidance was developed internally by AWS after tens of thousands of successful migrations. The guidance has proven effective as it provides motivation and a comprehensive approach to migration. Additionally, AWS will provide funding for AWS partners to assist with the migration efforts. The funding varies by phases and is distributed after completion of milestones.
Assess Phase: During this phase, a business case was created by InfoMagnus leveraging AWS services for inventory discovery, total cost of ownership (TCO) comparison, and workshops to assess PDS’s migration readiness. This resulted in a case for change that opened the next phase of migration, including:
Mobilization Phase:
AWS reviews the business case from the Assess, and approved InfoMagnus to proceed with the Mobilization Phase. This phase also included AWS funding to offset the customer’s cost of the work of InfoMagnus. This phase is to define how the migration will proceed.
‍
Migration Phase:
Resources are moved to AWS. They are tagged with a specific code that lets AWS track the services consumed, which then returns money back to the customer in the form of credits.
‍
Preparation Meets Opportunity: A Comprehensive Guide to AWS MAP Assessment with Insights from the Pacific Dental Case.
Embarking on an AWS MAP Assessment is not a task to be taken lightly. It requires meticulous preparation, alignment, and understanding of the platform. From setting aside dedicated time for the team to engage in the process to ensuring executive sponsorship, every detail matters.
The success of the MAP is contingent on a well-coordinated effort that includes a one-day Migration Readiness Assessment (MRA) workshop, requiring participation from a broad spectrum of the customer's experts. In the case of Pacific Dental, the challenges were multifaceted, ranging from a busy staff slow to adopt new technologies to a specific need for AWS expertise.
Let's take a look at the essential elements to prepare before embarking on an AWS MAP Assessment, highlighting the unique requirements and challenges faced by Pacific Dental, and how these shaped the assessment preparation. Whether it's understanding the AWS platform or creating an AWS account, every step is crucial in ensuring a smooth and successful migration.
‍
Essential Preparations for a Successful AWS MAP Assessment:
‍

‍
Allocate Team Time:
The AWS MAP process requires time commitment from your team to ensure everyone is assigned tasks, due dates, and remains focused on the final outcome. An integral part of the MAP Assessment is the Migration Readiness Assessment (MRA), a one-day workshop involving a cross-functional set of experts from the customer side—spanning strategy to infrastructure. Early commitment to the MRA is crucial for successful migration.
Executive Sponsorship:
A vital component to the success of any MAP is having an executive sponsor within the customer organization. This individual sets priorities and provides leadership, significantly accelerating the MAP process. An effective executive sponsor ensures that the migration project maintains momentum and doesn't stagnate due to shifts in team focus.
Basic AWS Understanding and Account Setup:
To proceed with the MAP Assessment, customers must have at least a rudimentary understanding of the AWS platform and set up an AWS account. AWS offers specialized services that assist in asset discovery, inventory management, and business case development, all of which require customer-side access for configuration and setup.
Specifics of the Pacific Dental Case: Challenges and Unique Requirements
When Pacific Dental Services embarked on their journey to the cloud through the AWS Migration Acceleration Program (MAP), they faced distinct challenges: a busy staff, cautious tech adoption, and a gap in AWS expertise. The partnership with InfoMagnus, an AWS Partner, proved to be instrumental in navigating these hurdles, offering invaluable guidance and skill throughout the migration assessment process.

Navigating Complex IT Migration to Revolutionize Crime-Solving with AWS.
share this:
Gabriel Lefrancois
Marketing Manager at InfoMagnus
In 2016, Captis Intelligence, in collaboration with InfoMagnus, embarked on an ambitious journey to disrupt the criminal investigation landscape. Their groundbreaking product, Solve A Crime, attracted a global community of over 20 million users across 30,000 locations nationwide. However, with scaling demands and the need for agility, the team recognized the urgency to migrate their complex architecture to a more streamlined, reliable environment. Enter Amazon Web Services (AWS), whose plethora of tools not only aligned with the project's multifaceted needs but also set the stage for future innovations.
‍
Addressing Technological Inadequacies to Enhance Crime Solving.
Law enforcement agencies are buckling under the strains of limited resources and an ever-increasing volume of unsolved crimes. Captis Intelligence sought to bridge this gap with their Solveacrime.com (SAC) platform. However, they encountered challenges tied to performance, scalability, and operational overhead in their existing IT setup.
The conundrum led them to reconsider their existing infrastructure and pave the way for an extensive migration to AWS, aiming to optimize both operational efficiencies and user engagement.
‍
The AWS Migration Journey.
The move to AWS was far from a mere transfer of assets—it was a full-scale digital transformation, optimized to exploit AWS's vast, interconnected landscape of services. This initiative not only streamlined existing operations but propelled Captis into a new echelon of scalability and performance. The following details everything this multi-layered migration consisted of, while revealing how each component was reconceptualized to resonate with AWS's state-of-the-art offerings.
DNS Transformation: From GoDaddy to Route 53
The initial phase of migration involved transitioning the Domain Name System (DNS) from GoDaddy to AWS Route 53. The move wasn't merely a change of platform; it was a strategic decision to benefit from Route 53's superior routing capabilities and to centralize services under the AWS ecosystem.
Content Delivery Overhaul: Cloudflare to Cloudfront
The quest for enhanced content distribution led the team to swap Cloudflare for AWS CloudFront. This switch facilitated better integration with other AWS services and delivered content to end-users with lower latency.
Network and Load Distribution: Migrating from Azure to AWS Elastic Load Balancers
While Azure had offered a competent load-balancing solution, Elastic Load Balancers provided a more dynamic and flexible approach, allowing the team to distribute incoming application or network traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances.
Application and Data Migration
The core API servers, previously hosted on Azure and a private cloud, were migrated to EC2 instances. Storage systems underwent a similar transition to AWS S3. These shifts dramatically streamlined the platform's architecture and simplified management operations.
Data Persistence: MySQL and Mongo Atlas
To ensure optimal database management, MySQL databases were migrated from Azure and private clouds to AWS RDS, while Mongo Atlas was hosted via EC2 instances. This dual migration offered a more efficient and consolidated data management solution.
Deployment and Monitoring: Atlassian/JFrog to CodeDeploy and Dynatrace
The software deployment process was overhauled from Atlassian/JFrog to AWS CodeDeploy, offering a more integrated environment for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). Monitoring was also elevated by migrating to Dynatrace, enabling detailed performance metrics.
Specialized Services: Text Indexing and Face Recognition
Text indexing tasks previously managed by legacy systems were migrated to AWS Elasticsearch, while face recognition technology transitioned from private solutions to AWS Rekognition. These specialized services benefited from AWS's proven scale and reliability.
Results: Realizing the AWS Advantage
Post-migration, the SAC platform has seen a significant reduction in operational complexities, latency, and costs. With AWS's robust set of tools, Captis Intelligence has successfully been able to focus on their core mission: reducing crime and enhancing public safety.
‍
Transforming Crime-Solving: How AWS Migration Elevates Public Safety.
The migration to AWS has been a calculated but necessary evolution for Captis Intelligence and InfoMagnus. It has allowed them to transcend traditional limitations and redefine the scope of community-driven crime-solving platforms. Today, they stand as a testament to the transformative power of well-executed IT migration strategies, equipped with a flexible, scalable AWS architecture that is ready to tackle future challenges.
This AWS migration journey is more than a case study—it’s a blueprint for organizations aiming to strategically align their technological infrastructure with overarching business goals.

Mastering GitHub: The Top 6 Factors to Consider in Choosing Your Training Partner.
share this:
InfoMagnus
Staff
The speed at which adaptation takes place can make all the difference in software development. Things like collaboration, making changes, and continuous learning allow for high-impact growth within an organization.
One tool that has become indispensable in this regard is GitHub, a platform that enables developers to work together on projects, share code, and learn from each other. However, to truly harness the power of GitHub, learning the platform is crucial.
Why? A proficient GitHub training partner can significantly enhance collaboration and efficiency within a team. By imparting a deep understanding of GitHub's functionalities, they can streamline the software development process, reducing the time and effort required to bring projects to fruition. Moreover, GitHub is not just a tool for collaboration, but also a platform for continuous learning and development. Developers can explore open-source projects, learn from their peers, and improve their coding skills. A good training partner can guide developers to leverage these opportunities, fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement.
The future of software development is increasingly intertwined with tools like GitHub – this is evidenced by Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub for a staggering $7.5 billion in 2018. By investing in effective GitHub training, organizations are not just enhancing their current operations, but are also preparing their teams for the future of software development. As we dive into the top six things to look for in a GitHub training partner, we'll explore how the right choice can help organizations maximize the benefits and set their teams up for success.
‍
Unlocking GitHub: The Indispensable Role of Expertise and Experience in Your Training Partner.
When it comes to mastering GitHub, there's no substitute for expertise and experience. It's not just about knowing the basics—it's about understanding the platform inside and out. And who better to guide your team on this journey than a training partner who's been there, done that, and got the Octocat t-shirt?
An experienced trainer has been in the thick of it. They've wrestled with the challenges, cracked the problems, and learned the nitty-gritty of GitHub. This means they can dish out practical, real-world examples that bring abstract concepts to life. They can also share insider tips and tricks that you won't find in any guidebook. This kind of insight is like gold dust. It gives your team a behind-the-scenes tour of GitHub, leading to a deeper, richer understanding of the platform.
What’s more, trainers with top-notch expertise can customize the training to fit your team’s needs. They know what skills are crucial, what's good to know, and what's just fluff. They can zero in on what matters to your team, making the training more targeted and efficient. Plus, they can tackle those tricky questions head-on, turning stumbling blocks into steppingstones.
Lastly, a training partner with a solid track record brings credibility to the table. Your team will be more likely to engage with the training if they respect the trainer's knowledge and skills. They'll listen, ask questions, and participate actively, leading to a more dynamic and effective learning experience.
‍
Tailoring Success: The Power of Customizable Training Programs in GitHub.
With tech training, one size definitely doesn't fit all. Every team has its unique needs, strengths, and goals. That's why customizable training programs are not just beneficial—they're essential. And when it comes to GitHub training, this becomes even more critical.
Let's talk about relevance. A customizable training program can be tailored to fit your team’s specific requirements. Whether your folks are non-developers, developers, administrators, or involved in migration and implementation, a tailored program can address their specific needs and challenges. This makes the training more relevant, engaging, and effective.
A customizable program can adapt to your team's pace and style of learning. Some people might grasp new concepts quickly, while others might need a bit more time. Some might prefer hands-on workshops, while others might learn better through discussion or self-study. A good training partner can tweak the program to suit these different learning styles, ensuring that everyone gets the most out of the training.
As your team becomes more proficient in GitHub, the training can level up too, introducing more advanced concepts and techniques. This keeps the training challenging and relevant, helping your team continue to develop their skills and knowledge.
‍
Leading the Charge: The Pivotal Role of the Trainer in GitHub.
In the world of GitHub training, the trainer isn't just a guide—they're the linchpin of the whole operation. They're the ones who can turn a good training program into a transformative experience. Let's break down why the role of the trainer is so crucial.
A trainer is more than just an expert—they're a leader. They're responsible for leading your team through the complexities of GitHub, moderating discussions, and building moments of reflection. They're the ones who can inspire your team to embrace change and strive for continuous improvement.
The trainer is also a mentor: to share their expertise, answer questions, and provide guidance. They can help your team navigate challenges, overcome roadblocks, and learn from their mistakes. This kind of one-on-one attention can make a huge difference in your team's learning journey.
The trainer is a communicator. They need to be able to explain complex concepts in a way that's easy to understand. They also need to communicate what's expected from the training in a clear and professional way. This ensures that everyone is on the same page and knows what to aim for.
A trainer can also be viewed as a role model. They set the standard for what it means to be proficient in GitHub. They demonstrate the skills, attitudes, and behaviors that lead to success. By setting a positive example, they can inspire your team to reach beyond what they thought was possible with complete confidence.
‍
Learning by Doing: The Power of Hands-On Learning Opportunities in GitHub Training.
Hands-on training can help facilitate the difference between knowing about GitHub and knowing how to use GitHub.
Hands-on learning is all about doing. It's about getting your hands dirty, making mistakes, and learning from them. It's about applying what you've learned to real-world situations. This kind of experiential learning can help your team understand GitHub on a deeper level, making the training more effective and engaging.
It can boost confidence. When your team gets to practice using GitHub, they get to see their skills in action. They get to see their progress, solve problems, and overcome challenges. This can give them the confidence to use GitHub in their day-to-day work.
This can also lead to different learning styles. Not everyone learns best by listening to a lecture or reading a manual. Some people learn best by doing. By providing hands-on learning opportunities, a good training partner can ensure that everyone in your team gets the most out of the workshop.
And finally, hands-on learning can make the training more enjoyable. Let's face it—learning by doing can be a lot more fun than learning by listening or reading. And when your team enjoys the training, they're more likely to engage with it and retain what they've learned.
‍
Beyond the Training: The Game-Changing Impact of Post-Training Support.
Training doesn't end when the workshops do. That's where post-training support comes into play. It's the extra mile that can make all the difference in your team's proficiency.
Post-training support is about reinforcing what's been learned. It's about helping your team apply their new skills and knowledge in the real world. This kind of ongoing support can help cement the knowledge gained, making it more likely to stick and be applied effectively.
It’s also about overcoming the forgetting curve—the brain's natural tendency to forget information that isn't being used. By providing regular reminders and opportunities to practice, post-training support can help your team retain what they've learned and keep their GitHub skills sharp.
The ability to reach-out provides a safety net for your team. It gives your team the confidence to apply their new skills, knowing that they have someone to turn to if they hit a roadblock. This can boost their confidence and encourage them to explore and make the most of GitHub.
Finally, post-training support is about continuous improvement. It's about helping your team keep up with the latest features and best practices in GitHub, ensuring that their skills remain up-to-date and relevant.
‍
Decoding Success: The Significance of Track Record and Reviews in Choosing Your GitHub Training Partner.
A training partner's track record is a testament to their experience and success. It shows that they've been in the game for a while and have a history of delivering results. When evaluating a training partner's track record, look for evidence of successful outcomes with previous clients. Have they helped other teams achieve their goals? Have they supported client success? A proven track record can give you confidence in the training partner's ability to deliver.
Reviews provide insights into the training partner's performance from the people who know best—their previous clients. They can tell you about the quality of the training, the effectiveness of the trainer, and the overall satisfaction with the training experience. When evaluating reviews, look for common themes. Are clients consistently praising the training partner for their expertise, support, or teaching methods? Are there any recurring criticisms? Reviews can give you a glimpse into what it's like to work with the training partner.
Both track record and reviews can indicate the training partner's reliability and credibility. They show that the training partner has a history of meeting or exceeding expectations and that they've earned the trust of their clients. This can give you peace of mind that the training partner will deliver on their promises.
‍
Sealing the Deal: The Final Word on Choosing Your Ideal Training Partner.
Choosing the right training partner is about more than just ticking boxes—it's about finding a partner who can provide expert-led training designed to educate, prepare, and deliver GitHub services. It's about finding a partner who can leverage exclusive resources to upskill your team and provide deep-dive training across GitHub Core, Migrations, Advanced Security, Advanced Actions, and more. It's about finding a partner who can deliver hands-on consulting, expert-led training, and workshops with GitHub.

Beyond Coding: How GitHub Integrations Streamline Software Delivery for Business.
share this:
InfoMagnus
Staff
In today's digital landscape, software is the engine driving business innovation. To build better software faster, organizations are increasingly turning to GitHub as the foundation for developer collaboration.
GitHub's flexible platform hosts code repositories, manages revisions, and connects contributors across the development lifecycle. While powerful on its own, GitHub's value expands exponentially when integrated with other platforms and tools.
From work tracking to CI/CD pipelines, code quality to communication apps, integrations enhance visibility, automation, and analytics. Seamlessly bridging GitHub activity across your technology stack unlocks game-changing efficiencies. But critical integrations that solve specific problems beat generic all-in-one solutions.
This article explores the benefits of smart GitHub integrations for optimizing workflows, speeding delivery, raising quality, and informing decisions. Follow our guide to amplify your business through targeted GitHub connections that meet the needs of both developers and the broader organization.
‍
Connecting Systems and Unlocking Value.
Organizations rely on software to deliver value, engage customers, and streamline operations.
Developing software internally requires efficient collaboration between teams. GitHub has become the de facto platform for software collaboration, with over 73 million developers building on GitHub. Integrating GitHub workflows into existing business tools unlocks major benefits through seamless collaboration, automation, visibility, and data-driven insights. Here are a handful of ways integrations can benefit your organization.
Seamless workflows:
Integrations allow teams to incorporate GitHub without disrupting existing tools and processes. For example, linking GitHub with Jira or Trello enables teams to connect issues with code changes. This improves traceability. Studies show development teams experience
a 22% increase in efficiency
from connecting project management with version control.
Visibility:
GitHub integrations provide greater visibility into developer activity. Managers can track pull requests, monitor progress on key initiatives, and get notified when high priority issues are updated. Lack of visibility into developer productivity can result in missed deadlines. Integrations solve this through timely notifications and project dashboards.
Automation:
Tedious tasks can be automated based on GitHub events, saving teams significant time. Workflows like CI/CD, code scanning, and documentation generation can be triggered automatically.
According to Gartner
, teams leveraging CI/CD workflows ship code 46 times more frequently and have 440 times faster lead times.
Insights:
Integrations enable data-driven decisions by capturing key metrics from the development process. Managers gain insights into cycle times, team velocity, defect rates, and technical debt. This allows them to identify bottlenecks, improve processes, and measure ROI on initiatives.
One survey showed 83% of IT leaders
leverage application and code analytics to drive higher business performance.
‍
Beyond Coding: Deep Dives into GitHub Integration Types and Tools.
GitHub integrations empower teams to build better software by connecting critical tools to collaborative coding. For example, traceability links between Jira tickets and code changes allowed Acme Inc to rapidly respond when a customer reported a bug caused by a last-minute requirement change.
While the possibilities are nearly endless, integrations generally fall into five key categories: project management, CI/CD, code quality, communication, and analytics.
Integrating GitHub activity into these critical systems unlocks major benefits like enhanced traceability, automated deployment pipelines, centralized notifications, and data-driven insights.
Below are some of the popular integrations in each category that showcase how they help optimize workflows, increase visibility, and boost productivity across software projects and organizations.
Project Management:
Integrations with
Jira
,
Trello
,
Asana
and other tools allow linking issues/tickets to code changes. This connects planning with implementation. An advanced benefit is traceability – teams can trace code back to requirements and tickets to understand the impact of changes. According to one survey, only 19% of developers have full traceability currently.
CI/CD Pipelines:
Integrations like
Jenkins
,
CircleCI
and
TravisCI
automate build, test and deployment steps. An open source option many don't know about is
Drone.io
which integrates natively with GitHub and uses Docker to simplify build environments. Advanced pipelines can enable progressive delivery by incrementally rolling out to larger sets of users to reduce risk.
Code Quality:
SonarQube
,
Code Climate
and other tools integrate to check code style, security, duplication and more. This helps enforce quality standards and best practices. A lesser-known benefit is the ability to track technical debt over time. This is invaluable for planning refactoring work.
Communication:
Slack and Microsoft Teams enable notifications about repository events. An innovative integration is
CodeStream
– it allows commenting directly in the code. This ties conversations to specific parts of the codebase to improve context.
Analytics:
Metabase
,
Datadog
and and
Codacy
enable data-driven decisions by capturing key metrics from software development. These tools provide visibility into team productivity, cycle times for issues, code change frequency, defect rates, and technical debt.
Advanced options can even offer automated code reviews and quality analysis, along with tracking annotations over time. This gives engineering leaders rich insights into bottlenecks, quality trends, and the long-term maintenance needs of the codebase. With the right data, organizations can optimize processes, improve planning, and measure the ROI of initiatives.
Whether it’s supercharging agile practices, enabling continuous delivery, improving code quality, enhancing visibility, or leveraging analytics, GitHub integrations provide tangible benefits for engineering and business stakeholders alike.
The key is choosing the right integrations that solve pain points within an organization's specific toolchain and workflows. While the possibilities are vast, starting small and building up GitHub connections over time is recommended.
‍
Strategic Implementation of GitHub Integrations.
While GitHub integrations offer a plethora of advantages, such as automation and collaboration, they necessitate meticulous planning and governance to fully realize their potential. Businesses must conduct a comprehensive evaluation of several factors, including capabilities, data security, access controls, change management, and scalability, before implementing integrations on a wider scale.
Capabilities Needed:
Understanding the specific pain points that integrations can address and identifying the most impactful capabilities for your workflows is paramount. An audit by OpsRamp found that a staggering 67% of IT teams fail to utilize even half of their available tool integrations. This underscores the importance of fully leveraging your existing technology stack before considering expansion.
Data Security:
Data security is a critical concern when implementing third-party integrations. A survey by nVisium revealed that 57% of companies have suffered a breach via a third-party vendor. It's essential to meticulously assess access levels and data sharing protocols, enforcing least privilege permissions, and maintaining rigorous audit logs to mitigate risks.
Access Controls:
Implementing robust controls around credential management and authorization is vital. Tools like
HashiCorp Vault
can provide secrets management, ensuring that only approved users have the ability to configure integrations. This layer of security helps in maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information.
Change Management:
Change management is a multifaceted process that requires careful planning. Rolling out integrations incrementally, coupled with comprehensive training and support, can facilitate a smoother transition.
A study by McKinsey found that 70% of transformations
fail due to lack of uptake, emphasizing the need for developer buy-in and alignment with new workflows.
Start Small:
The allure of connecting all tools at once can be tempting but may lead to complexity and confusion. It's wise to evaluate a minimal set of high-value integrations, pilot them with a dedicated team, and then expand based on the insights gained. By focusing on solving critical problems first, organizations can ensure a more targeted and effective implementation.
‍
Unlocking the Power of GitHub Integrations
GitHub has become the epicenter of software collaboration and integration.
While integrations provide immense benefits, they require planning and governance to maximize impact. Start small by connecting GitHub to tools that solve immediate pain points in your workflows. Expand thoughtfully over time as your needs evolve. Approach integrations as a platform for connecting people and processes, not just technologies. Focus on change management and adoption as much as technical implementation.
Integrations present an opportunity to unify software development efforts across your business like never before. But lasting results require integrations that enhance, not hinder, developer productivity and team collaboration. With the right strategy grounded in solving high-priority problems, GitHub integrations can help propel your business to new levels of efficiency, visibility, and innovation.

InfoMagnus Partners with Broadcom to Deliver GitHub Webinars, Engaging Approximately 3,000+ Developers Across the Globe
‍
Huntington Beach, Calif., September 10, 2024
– InfoMagnus, a GitHub Advanced Partner, recently concluded multiple customized GitHub webinars, hosted in collaboration with Broadcom. These sessions, aimed at individual contributors, reached more than 1,500+ participants in the U.S., around 850+ in India, and more recently, approximately 600+ participants across three sessions for the Broadcom European team.
Delivered via Zoom, the webinars offered a high-level introduction to GitHub, designed to help Broadcom’s team explore new opportunities for platform integration. InfoMagnus condensed its 12-hour Admin and Developer trainings into focused 2-hour sessions, making GitHub more accessible to a broader audience. The webinars included live demos and a “show and tell” format, garnering positive feedback and high engagement. The education component is crucial as Broadcom’s teams migrate from GitLab to GitHub, with training providing developers the confidence to adopt the platform successfully.
‍
"These webinars allow us to present GitHub in a nimbler format, serving as an introduction before diving deeper into full-scale trainings," said Tam Baghdassarian, Technical Director, Data & AI Services at InfoMagnus.
‍
With strong interest and feedback so far, InfoMagnus will continue to refine the content, ensuring future webinars deliver at the highest level possible. InfoMagnus looks forward to fostering deeper connections through tailored GitHub solutions for Broadcom and other partners worldwide.
Over the past year-and-a-half, InfoMagnus has delivered more than 144 GitHub Admin and 123 GitHub Developer trainings, further establishing its expertise in GitHub solutions. Through these efforts, InfoMagnus has trained over 8,000+ developers on all components of the GitHub platform and provided more than 20,000 consulting hours to enterprise and mid-level accounts.

Captis Intelligence and InfoMagnus Transform Crime-Solving Landscape Through AWS Migration.
October 16, 2023 – (Huntington Beach, CA)
– Captis Intelligence, a disruptor in the criminal investigation sector, and InfoMagnus, a leading IT solutions provider, announce the successful migration of their landmark product, Solve A Crime, to Amazon Web Services (AWS). This strategic move catapults Captis into a new realm of operational agility, performance, and scalability, addressing the burgeoning demands of a global user base that has now crossed 20 million.
The Inflection Point: Addressing Business and Technological Challenges
Law enforcement agencies have been grappling with limited resources and a mounting backlog of unsolved crimes. Captis Intelligence's Solveacrime.com (SAC) platform aimed to bridge this yawning gap but encountered constraints in their existing IT infrastructure.
The AWS migration has been more than a technological pivot; it marks a paradigm shift aimed at optimizing both user engagement and operational efficiencies.
The Guts of the Migration: A Multi-layered Transformation
Dario Brebric, President of Captis Intelligence, notes that this wasn't "a mere transfer of assets" but rather a "full-scale digital transformation." AWS's vast, interconnected service landscape has become the linchpin for Solve A Crime's enhanced capabilities, from DNS transformation and content delivery to application and data migration.
DNS Transformation:
The transition from GoDaddy to AWS Route 53 wasn’t merely a change of venue but a strategic move to exploit Route 53’s robust routing capabilities.
Content Delivery Overhaul:
Switching from Cloudflare to AWS CloudFront has drastically improved content distribution, integrating seamlessly with AWS's other state-of-the-art services.
Application and Data Migration:
The core API servers and storage systems have been migrated to AWS EC2 and S3, simplifying the platform’s architecture and management operations.
Specialized Services:
Text indexing and face recognition technologies, once run on legacy systems, are now powered by AWS Elasticsearch and AWS Rekognition, respectively.
The Aftermath: A Paradigm Shift in Community-Driven Crime Solving
"The team at InfoMagnus delivered the right technologies and support for our industry-first, Solveacrime.com product, allowing us to achieve the desired timeframe and take the product to market," said Dario Brebric, President of Captis Intelligence.
Since the AWS migration, SAC has realized reductions in operational complexities, latency, and costs. With a now-optimized set of tools, Captis Intelligence can focus on what they do best: enhancing public safety and reducing crime.
About Captis Intelligence
Captis Intelligence disrupts the criminal investigation landscape with its Solve A Crime platform, now backed by an agile, scalable AWS architecture.
About InfoMagnus
InfoMagnus provides world-class IT solutions, offering unparalleled support in digital transformations like the one undertaken by Captis Intelligence.

Our goal is to not only provide you with a working solution, but to also equip your organization to be self-sufficient.
This includes helping develop your team as it learns new technologies and approaches to IT excellence. We intend to achieve success with you, not for you.
Customer Focused Design
Engaging with you and your customers enables us to more easily turn up opportunities for increased value in interface design, process implementation and user expectations.

We measure the time it takes our people to complete tasks allowing us to create a baseline that sets new system performance expectations in terms of user efficiency.

We build a set of personas that describe the categories of users that interact with the system. This measurement is used as a baseline to set new system performance expectations in terms of user efficiency.
Point Based Estimation
We estimate features using a method called points-based estimation to quickly size items and easily determine what features will cost more than others.
Software Walkthroughs
We rhythmically engage with the business to solicit feedback on the current software version. This drives better clarity, regular feedback, and gives us the ability to constantly course correct.
Analysis Engagement
We actively test the software on a weekly basis to determine progress against business objectives. Our analysts serve as a guidance system for the program throughout the construction life-cycle.

we help startups succeed with our MVP in-a-box package
You are a start-up company with the desire to turn your innovative ideas into products but need help to build a software solution.
Often, startups waste their funding by hiring inexperienced developers and, on average, switch 4 times before achieving their product goals.
With our “MVP In-A-Box” package, we offer startup companies the ability to deliver a real product, not a tappable prototype, for a set price between $60,000 - $75,000.
we bring the entire software development lifecycle to your organization
At InfoMagnus, we have spent the last 8 years helping over a dozen startup companies reach their goals by deploying an effective, cost-conscious hybrid model of technologists based in the United States and support from our own team in India, to ensure your MVP release falls within budget.

liftoff
we help startups succeed with our MVP in-a-box package
You are a start-up company with the desire to turn your innovative ideas into products but need help to build a software solution.
Often, startups waste their funding by hiring inexperienced developers and, on average, switch 4 times before achieving their product goals.
With our “MVP In-A-Box” package, we offer startup companies the ability to deliver a real product, not a tappable prototype, for a set price between $60,000 - $75,000.
we bring the entire software development lifecycle to your organization
At InfoMagnus, we have spent the last 8 years helping over a dozen startup companies reach their goals by deploying an effective, cost-conscious hybrid model of technologists based in the United States and support from our own team in India, to ensure your MVP release falls within budget.

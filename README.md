# SQL Server Python Connector
# Description
This project demonstrates how to connect to a SQL Server database using Python and the pyodbc library. It includes Python code for setting up a connection to a database and executing various SQL queries.

# Features
Connect to SQL Server databases using Python.
Execute queries to fetch and manipulate data.
Includes connection configuration and sample queries for employees.

# Installation
# Prerequisites
Python 3.1+

SQL Server ODBC driver installed on your machine (check your SQL Server version for the appropriate driver).

# Step-by-Step Instructions
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/BhanuSri-infomagnus/Bootcamp.git
cd Bootcamp

# Set up a virtual environment:

Windows:

python -m venv venv

macOS/Linux:

python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment:

Windows:

venv\Scripts\activate

macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies:
After activating the virtual environment, install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure Database Connection:

Update the sql_connection.py file with your SQL Server credentials, such as server name, database name, username, and password.

# Run the code:
After setting up the environment and configuring the connection, run the script to test the connection:

python sql_connection.py

# Usage
Example Code: sql_connection.py

import pyodbc

# Set up the database connection
conn = pyodbc.connect(
    'DRIVER={SQL Server};' 
    'SERVER=your_server_name;'
    'DATABASE=AdventureWorksDW2022;'
    'UID=your_username;'
    'PWD=your_password'
)

cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute a query
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM DimEmployee")

# Fetch and print results
for row in cursor.fetchall():
    print(row)

# Close connection
conn.close()
Expected Output:

A list of records from the DimEmployee table will be displayed.

# Requirements
The following libraries are required for this project:

pyodbc: Python ODBC interface for connecting to SQL databases.

You can install them by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# .gitignore Example
This repository contains a .gitignore file to ensure that unnecessary files, such as the virtual environment, are not committed to the Git repository.

# How to Customize
Update your connection details: Replace the placeholders (your_server_name, your_username, your_password) with actual values to connect to your SQL Server instance.

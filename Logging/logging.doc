The logging module in Python is a built-in library used to report status, errors, warnings, or debug messages in your programs â€” without using print() statements.

Why Use logging Instead of print()?

More control over output format and levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR)
Logs can be saved to files
Supports different destinations (console, file, email, etc.)
Better for production-level code and debugging


Logging Levels
Level	Use Case
DEBUG	Detailed information, mainly for debugging
INFO	Confirmation that things work as expected
WARNING	Something unexpected but not breaking
ERROR	A more serious problem
CRITICAL	Serious error, the program might crash
